We analyzed the frequency of PD-L1 expression in glioma samples. Methodology In this two-year retrospective study, 45 glioma cases of varying grades (grades 2 to 4) were examined at a tertiary care hospital. Tumor samples that were formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) were obtained from the pathology archives of the hospital. According to the WHO Classification of Central Nervous System Tumors, 5th edition, tumor grading and histopathological subtyping were carried out. PD-L1 antibody (clone 28-8) and IDH1 (R132H, clone QM002, Quartett Immunodiagnostika, 1:100 dilution) markers were used for immunohistochemistry (IHC). The sections underwent deparaffinization, rehydration, and antigen retrieval using Leica bond III staining platform. Based on the tumor proportion score (TPS), which is the proportion of viable tumor cells with membranous staining, PD-L1 expression was assessed. The literature's standardized cut-off values were used to determine positive expression. Staining intensity and tumor cell location were used to determine the status of IDH1 mutations. Age, sex, and tumor location were among the clinical and demographic information gathered about the patient. The association between PD-L1 expression, glioma grades, and IDH1 (R132H) mutation status was assessed statistically using SPSS software and a Chi-square test. The threshold for statistical significance was p < 0.05. For every IHC run, positive and negative controls were used as part of the quality control procedures. To reduce bias and guarantee consistency, two pathologists and post graduate residents independently reviewed the results. Results PD-L1 expression was found in 27 out of 36 (75%) grade 4 glioblastoma multiforme cases and six out of nine (66.7%) grade 2 gliomas. Overall, 33/45 (73.3%) of the gliomas had PD-L1 expression. However, PD-L1 expression and glioma grade did not correlate in a statistically significant way. IDH1 (R132H) expression and PD-L1 were found to be inversely correlated (p < 0.05). Conclusion The findings suggest that PD-L1 may be a promising therapeutic target, even in the absence of significant grade-specific trends by\xa0demonstrating PD-L1 presence in the majority of glioma cases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in GBM immunotherapy. The results provide insight into the immune landscape of gliomas and pave the way for future research into effective combination therapies for GBM, despite the lack of a significant correlation between glioma grade and PD-L1 expression.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Non-canonical mutations such as BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>, found in 1-2% of GBMs, activate the MEK-ERK signaling pathway. This mutation can be targeted by small molecule inhibitors, offering therapeutic potential for GBM. In this case report, we describe the management of a 67-year-old male with BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> -mutant GBM, who experienced both local clonal and distant non-clonal BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> -mutant recurrences. Initial treatment involved surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and temozolomide (TMZ). Subsequent recurrences were managed with re-resection and dabrafenib/trametinib combination therapy. Notably, a new, non-clonal BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> -negative tumor developed in a distant location, highlighting the challenge of clonal evolution and resistance in GBM management. The patient's disease ultimately progressed despite multiple lines of therapy, including targeted inhibition. Identifying mechanisms of resistance and tailoring flexible treatment approaches are essential for advancing outcomes in BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> -mutant GBM. This case emphasizes the value of molecular profiling in personalizing treatment for patients with multifocal disease. The evolving nature of these tumors requires persistent clinical monitoring and treatment adjustments based on tissue diagnostics.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

We found that 5.4% of glioblastomas harbored IDH1 mutations, correlating with improved overall survival (OS) (p = 2.196e-3). Different glioblastoma cohorts showed a diverse IDH1 mutational prevalence (4-31%). Despite this, IDH1<sup>Mu</sup> was consistently associated with better OS (p = 8.235e-5).

Differential co-expression analyses revealed distinct gene and miRNA profiles for IDH1<sup>Wt</sup> and IDH1<sup>Mu</sup> glioblastomas, with specific upregulation of PTEN and downregulation of MUC16 in IDH1<sup>Wt</sup>, and upregulation of PIK3R1 in IDH1<sup>Mu</sup>. Additionally, PIK3R1 and ITGB2 emerged as critical druggable targets. Our findings indicate that PDCD1 and CD274 are highly expressed irrespective of IDH1 mutation statuses, suggesting that glioblastomas could benefit from immunotherapy.

In the following 20 years, it has lived up to expectations. A substantial body of evidence has demonstrated that it is closely related to the development, metastasis, migration, and drug resistance of malignant tumors. In recent years, research on the MSI protein has advanced, and many novel viewpoints and drug resistance attempts have been derived; for example, tumor protein p53 mutations and MSI-binding proteins lead to resistance to protein arginine N-methyltransferase 5-targeted therapy in lymphoma patients. Moreover, the high expression of MSI2 in pancreatic cancer might suppress its development and progression. As a significant member of the MSI family, MSI2 is closely associated with multiple malignant tumors, including hematological disorders, common abdominal tumors, and other tumor types (e.g., glioblastoma, breast cancer). MSI2 is highly expressed in the majority of tumors and is related to a poor disease prognosis. However, its specific expression levels and regulatory mechanisms may differ based on the tumor type. This review summarizes the research progress related to MSI2 in recent years, including its occurrence, migration mechanism, and drug resistance, as well as the prospect of developing tumor immunosuppressants and biomarkers.\n\nConsider:\n1.

These rare tumors were assigned to a new subgroup, G3/MMR, a G3/NF1 subgroup spin-off, as they generally show genomic alterations leading to RAS activation, such as <i>NF1</i> and <i>PTPN11</i> mutations. An integrated clinical, histologic and molecular analysis of the G3/MMR tumors showed distinct characteristics as compared to other glioblastomas, including those with iatrogenic high tumor mutation burden (TMB), warranting a separate subgroup.

The MGCs and p53 immunohistochemistry analysis in G1-G7 subgroups showed that one in 7 tumors with these characteristics is a G3/MMR glioblastoma. The FDA-approved first-line therapy for many advanced solid tumors consists of nivolumab-ipilimumab immune checkpoint inhibitors. One G3/MMR patient received this regimen and survived much longer than the rest, setting a proof-of-principle example for the treatment of these very aggressive G3/MMR glioblastomas.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Disruption of the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway in tumor cells enhances the effectiveness of radiotherapy drugs, while increased mutational burden following tumor cell damage also facilitates the efficacy of immunotherapy. The ATRX gene, located on chromosome X, plays a crucial role in DDR. The aim of this research is to elucidate the correlation between ATRX mutations and GBM. Dataset obtained from TCGA-GBM were conducted an analysis on the genomic features, biological characteristics, immunopathological markers, and clinical prognosis of patients carrying ATRX mutations. Our findings revealed a significantly elevated level of microsatellite instability in individuals with ATRX mutants, along with significant alterations in the receptor-tyrosine kinase (RTK)-ras pathway among patients exhibiting combined ATRX mutations. TCGA-GBM patients with concurrent ATRX mutations exhibited sensitivity to 26 chemotherapeutic and anticancer drugs, which exerted their effects by modulating the DDR of tumor cells through highly correlated mechanisms involving the RTK-ras pathway. Additionally, we observed an enrichment of ATRX mutations in specific pathways associated with DDR among TCGA-GBM patients. Our model also demonstrated prolonged overall survival in patients carrying ATRX mutations, particularly showing strong predictive value for 3- and 5-year survival rates. Furthermore, additional protective factors such as younger age, female gender, combined IDH mutations, and TP53 mutations were identified. The results underscore the protective role and prognostic significance of ATRX mutations in GBM as a potential therapeutic target and biomarker for patient survival.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Necroptosis, a pathological hallmark of GBM, is poorly understood in terms of its role in prognosis, tumor microenvironment (TME) alteration, and immunotherapy. We assessed the expression of 55 necroptosis-related genes in GBM and normal brain tissues. We identified necroptosis-stratified clusters using Uni-Cox and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression to establish the 10-gene Glioblastoma Necroptosis Index (GNI). GNI demonstrated significant prognostic efficacy in the TCGA dataset (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u2009160) and internal validation dataset (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u2009345) and in external validation cohorts (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u2009591). The GNI-high subgroup displayed a mesenchymal phenotype, lacking the IDH1 mutation, and MGMT methylation. This subgroup was characterized by significant enrichment in inflammatory and humoral immune pathways with prominent cell adhesion molecules (CD44 and ICAM1), inflammatory cytokines (TGFB1, IL1B, and IL10), and chemokines (CX3CL1, CXCL9, and CCL5). The TME in this subgroup showed elevated infiltration of M0 macrophages, neutrophils, mast cells, and regulatory T cells. GNI-related genes appeared to limit macrophage polarization, as confirmed by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. The top 30% high-risk score subset exhibited increased CD8 T cell infiltration and enhanced cytolytic activity. GNI showed promise in predicting responses to immunotherapy and targeted treatment. Our study highlights the role of necroptosis-related genes in glioblastoma (GBM) and their effects on the tumor microenvironment and patient prognosis. TheGNI demonstrates potential as a prognostic marker and provides insights into immune characteristics and treatment responsiveness.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

Expression subtypes of GBM samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were identified using BayesNM and compared with existing molecular subtypes of GBM. Biological features of the subtypes were determined by single-sample gene set enrichment analysis. Genomic and proteomic data from GBM samples were combined and Genomic Identification of Significant Targets in Cancer analysis was used to screen genes with recurrent somatic copy-number alterations phenomenon. The immune environment among subtypes was compared by assessing the expression of immune molecules and the infiltration of immune cells. Molecular subtypes adapted to immunotherapy were identified based on Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) score. Finally, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression was performed on the expression profiles of S2, S3 and S4 in TCGA-GBM and RPPA to determine the respective corresponding best predictive model. Four novel molecular subtypes were classified. Specifically, S1 exhibited a low proliferative profile; S2 exhibited the profile of high proliferation, IDH1 mutation, TP53 mutation and deletion; S3 was characterized by high immune scores, innate immunity and adaptive immune infiltration scores, with the lowest TIDE score and was most likely to benefit from immunotherapy; S4 was characterized by high proliferation, EGFR amplification, and high protein abundance, and was the most suitable subtype for bevacizumab. LASSO analysis constructed the best prediction model composed of 13 genes in S2 with an accuracy of 96.7%, and the prediction model consisting of 17 genes in S3 with an accuracy of 86.7%, and screened 14 genes as components of the best prediction model in S4 with an accuracy of 93%. To conclude, our study classified reproducible and robust molecular subtypes of GBM, and these findings might contribute to the identification of patients responding to immunotherapy, thereby improving GBM prognosis.\n\nConsider:\n1.

To address these issues and personalise treatment approaches, we aimed to develop and validate robust multiomics molecular subtypes of IDHwt-GBM. Through this, we sought to uncover the distinct molecular signatures underlying these subtypes, paving the way for improved diagnosis and targeted therapy for this challenging disease. To identify stable molecular subtypes among 184 IDHwt-GBM patients from TCGA, we used the consensus clustering method to consolidate the results from ten advanced multiomics clustering approaches based on mRNA, lncRNA, and mutation data. We developed subtype prediction models using the PAM and machine learning algorithms based on mRNA and MRI data for enhanced clinical utility. These models were validated in five independent datasets, and an online interactive system was created. We conducted a comprehensive assessment of the clinical impact, drug treatment response, and molecular associations of the IDHwt-GBM subtypes. In the TCGA cohort, two molecular subtypes, class 1 and class 2, were identified through multiomics clustering of IDHwt-GBM patients. There was a significant difference in survival between Class 1 and Class 2 patients, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.68 [1.15-2.47]. This difference was validated in other datasets (CGGA: HR\u2009=\u20091.75[1.04, 2.94]; CPTAC: HR\u2009=\u20091.79[1.09-2.91]; GALSS: HR\u2009=\u20091.66[1.09-2.54]; UCSF: HR\u2009=\u20091.33[1.00-1.77]; UPENN HR\u2009=\u20091.29[1.04-1.58]). Additionally, class 2 was more sensitive to treatment with radiotherapy combined with temozolomide, and this sensitivity was validated in the GLASS cohort. Correspondingly, class 2 and class 1 exhibited significant differences in mutation patterns, enriched pathways, programmed cell death (PCD), and the tumour immune microenvironment. Class 2 had more mutation signatures associated with defective DNA mismatch repair (P\u2009=\u20090.0021). Enriched pathways of differentially expressed genes in class 1 and class 2 (P-adjust\u2009<\u20090.05) were mainly related to ferroptosis, the PD-1 checkpoint pathway, the JAK-STAT signalling pathway, and other programmed cell death and immune-related pathways. The different cell death modes and immune microenvironments were validated across multiple datasets. Finally, our developed survival prediction model, which integrates molecular subtypes, age, and sex, demonstrated clinical benefits based on the decision curve in the test set. We deployed the molecular subtyping prediction model and survival prediction model online, allowing interactive use and facilitating user convenience. Molecular subtypes were identified and verified through multiomics clustering in IDHwt-GBM patients. These subtypes are linked to specific mutation patterns, the immune microenvironment, prognoses, and treatment responses.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

Pediatric glioblastoma is a rare and aggressive brain tumor that presents unique challenges in treatment. It differs from its adult counterpart in terms of genetic and molecular characteristics. Its incidence is relatively low, but the prognosis remains grim due to its aggressive behavior. Diagnosis relies on imaging techniques and histopathological analysis. The rarity of the disease underscores the need for effective treatment strategies. In recent years, the quest to understand and manage pediatric glioblastoma has seen a significant shift towards unraveling the intricate landscape of biomarkers. Surgery remains a cornerstone of glioblastoma management, aiming to resect as much of the tumor as possible. Glioblastoma's infiltrative nature presents challenges in achieving a complete surgical resection. This comprehensive review delves into the realm of pediatric glioblastoma biomarkers, shedding light on their potential to not only revolutionize diagnostics but also shape therapeutic strategies. From personalized treatment selection to the development of targeted therapies, the potential impact of these biomarkers on clinical outcomes is undeniable. Moreover, this review underscores the substantial implications of biomarker-driven approaches for therapeutic interventions. All advancements in targeted therapies and immunotherapy hold promise for the treatment of pediatric glioblastoma. The genetic profiling of tumors allows for personalized approaches, potentially improving treatment efficacy. The ethical dilemmas surrounding pediatric cancer treatment, particularly balancing potential benefits with risks, are complex. Ongoing clinical trials and preclinical research suggest exciting avenues for future interventions.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2. Study type and methodology\n3.

With an evolving understanding of its underlying biology, there is an urgent need to identify prognostic molecular groups that can be subject to targeted therapy. This study established a cohort of 124 sequential glioblastomas from a tertiary hospital and aimed to find correlations between molecular features and survival outcomes. Comprehensive molecular characterization of the cohort revealed prevalent alterations as previously described, such as TERT promoter mutations and involvement of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR, CK4/6-CDKN2A/B-RB1, and p14ARF-MDM2-MDM4-p53 pathways. MGMT promoter methylation is a significant predictor of improved overall survival, aligned with previous data. Conversely, age showed a marginal association with higher mortality. Multivariate analysis to account for the effect of MGMT promoter methylation and age showed that, in contrast to other published series, this cohort demonstrated improved survival for tumors harboring PTEN mutations, and that there was no observed difference for most other molecular alterations, including EGFR amplification, RB1 loss, or the coexistence of EGFR amplification and deletion/exon skipping (EGFRvIII). Despite limitations in sample size, this study contributes data to the molecular landscape of glioblastomas, prompting further investigations to examine these findings more closely in larger cohorts.\n\nConsider:\n1.

This review delves into the potential of targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) with small-molecule inhibitors and antibodies as a treatment strategy. EGFR, a mutationally active receptor tyrosine kinase in over 50% of glioblastoma cases, features variants like EGFRvIII, EGFRvII and missense mutations, necessitating a deep understanding of their structures and signaling pathways. Although EGFR inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in other cancers, their application in glioblastoma is hindered by blood-brain barrier penetration and intrinsic resistance. The evolving realm of nanodrugs and convection-enhanced delivery offers promise in ensuring precise drug delivery to the brain. Critical to success is the identification of glioblastoma patient populations that benefit from EGFR inhibitors. Tools like radiolabeled anti-EGFR antibody 806i facilitate the visualization of EGFR conformations, aiding in tailored treatment selection. Recognizing the synergistic potential of combination therapies with downstream targets like mTOR, PI3k, and HDACs is pivotal for enhancing EGFR inhibitor efficacy. In conclusion, the era of precision oncology holds promise for targeting EGFR in glioblastoma, contingent on tailored treatments, effective blood-brain barrier navigation, and the exploration of synergistic therapies.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Patients receive surgery and chemoradiotherapy but tumors almost always fatally recur. Using RNA sequencing data from 107 pairs of pre- and post-standard treatment locally recurrent IDHwt GBM tumors, we identify two responder subtypes based on longitudinal changes in gene expression. In two thirds of patients, a specific subset of genes is upregulated from primary to recurrence (Up responders), and in one third, the same genes are downregulated (Down responders), specifically in neoplastic cells. Characterization of the responder subtypes indicates subtype-specific adaptive treatment resistance mechanisms that are associated with distinct changes in the tumor microenvironment. In Up responders, recurrent tumors are enriched in quiescent proneural GBM stem cells and differentiated neoplastic cells, with increased interaction with the surrounding normal brain and neurotransmitter signaling, whereas Down responders commonly undergo mesenchymal transition. ChIP-sequencing data from longitudinal GBM tumors suggests that the observed transcriptional reprogramming could be driven by Polycomb-based chromatin remodeling rather than DNA methylation. We show that the responder subtype is cancer-cell intrinsic, recapitulated in in vitro GBM cell models, and influenced by the presence of the tumor microenvironment. Stratifying GBM tumors by responder subtype may lead to more effective treatment.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2. Study type and methodology\n3. Population characteristics\n4.

The vast majority of these biomarkers, used to discriminate between tumour types, also offered prognostic information. With the advent of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and other large genomic datasets, further prognostic sub-stratification was possible within tumour types, leading to increased precision in CNS tumour grading. This review outlines the evolution of the molecular landscape of adult CNS tumours, through the prism of World Health Organization (WHO) Classifications. We begin our journey in the pre-molecular era, where high-grade gliomas were divided into 'primary' and 'secondary' glioblastomas. Molecular alterations explaining these clinicopathological observations were the first branching points of glioma diagnostics, with the discovery of IDH1/2 mutations and 1p/19q codeletion. Subsequently, the rigorous characterisation of paediatric gliomas led to the unearthing of histone H3 alterations as a key event in gliomagenesis, which also had implications for young adult patients. Simultaneously, studies investigating prognostic biomarkers within tumour types were undertaken. Certain genomic phenotypes were found to portend unfavourable outcomes, for example, MYCN amplification in spinal ependymoma. The arrival of methylation profiling, having revolutionised the diagnosis of CNS tumours, now promises to bring increased prognostic accuracy, as has been shown in meningiomas. While MGMT promoter hypermethylation has remained a reliable biomarker of response to cytotoxic chemotherapy, targeted therapy in CNS tumours has unfortunately not had the success of other cancers. Therefore, predictive biomarkers have lagged behind the identification of prognostic biomarkers in CNS tumours. Emerging research from new clinical trials is cause for guarded optimism and may shift our conceptualisation of predictive biomarker testing in CNS tumours.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Evidence suggests that glioma stem cells (GSCs) contribute to this resistance. Mithramycin (Mit-A) targets GSCs and exhibits antitumor activity in GBM by affecting transcriptional targets such as SRY-related HMG-box transcription factor 2 (SOX2), oligodendrocyte lineage transcription factor 2 (OLIG2), and zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1). However, its clinical use has been limited by toxicity. This study explored the diagnostic potential of serum extracellular vesicles (EVs) to identify Mit-A responders. Serum EVs were isolated from 70 glioma patients, and targeted gene expression was analyzed using qRT-PCR. Using chemosensitivity assay, we identified 8 Mit-A responders and 17 nonresponders among 25 glioma patients. The M-score showed a significant correlation (<i>p</i> = 0.045) with isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 mutation but not other clinical variables. The genes SOX2 (<i>p</i> = 0.005), OLIG2 (<i>p</i> = 0.003), and ZEB1 (<i>p</i> = 0.0281) were found to be upregulated in the responder EVs. SOX2 had the highest diagnostic potential (AUC = 0.875), followed by OLIG2 (AUC = 0.772) and ZEB1 (AUC = 0.632).The combined gene panel showed significant diagnostic efficacy (AUC = 0.956) through logistic regression analysis. The gene panel was further validated in the serum EVs of 45 glioma patients. These findings highlight the potential of Mit-A as a targeted therapy for high-grade glioma based on differential gene expression in serum EVs. The gene panel could serve as a diagnostic tool to predict Mit-A sensitivity, offering a promising approach for personalized treatment strategies and emphasizing the role of GSCs in therapeutic resistance.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Further, their immune profile was compared with GB, IDH1 wild-type (wt) (n-18). Morphologically, PXAG2 mostly differed from eGB; however, it was occasionally difficult to differentiate PXAG3 from eGB due to their epithelioid pattern and less obvious degenerative features. PXAG2 showed predominantly diffuse, whereas variable positivity for epithelial and glial markers was seen in PXAG3 and eGB. All cases showed retained nuclear ATRX and INI-1 . H3K27M or IDH1 mutation was seen in none. P53 mutation was more common in eGB, followed by PXAG3, and least common in PXAG2. BRAF V600E mutation was observed in 66.67% PXAG2, 33.33% PXAG3, and 50% eGB, with 100% concordance between immunohistochemistry (IHC) and sequencing. Thirty-six percent eGB, 33% PXAG3, and 61% PXAG2 harbored CDKN2A homozygous deletion. EGFR amplification was observed in 14% eGB and 66% of GB, IDH wt. PDL1 and CTLA-4 expression was higher in eGB (71.4% and 57.1%), PXAG3 (66.6% and100%), and PXAG2 (60% & 66.7%) as compared with GB, IDH wt (38.8% and 16.7%). Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were also observed in a majority of eGB and PXA (90% to 100%) in contrast to GB, IDH wt (66%). This analysis highlights the homogenous molecular and immune profile of eGB and PXA, suggesting the possibility that histologically and molecularly, these two entities represent 2 ends of a continuous spectrum with PXAG3 lying in between. Higher upregulation of PDL1, CTLA-4, and increased tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in these tumors as compared with GB, IDH wt suggests potential candidature for immunotherapy.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Using glioblastoma (GBM) as a representative example of high-grade gliomas, we evaluated the clonal architecture and distribution of hotspot mutations in 388 GBMs from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Mutations were matched with 54 targeted therapies, followed by a comprehensive evaluation of drug biochemical properties in reference to the drug's clinical efficacy in high-grade gliomas. We then assessed clinical outcomes of a cohort of patients with high-grade gliomas with targetable mutations reviewed at the Johns Hopkins Molecular Tumor Board (JH MTB; <i>n</i>\u2009=\u200950). Among 1,156 sequence alterations evaluated, 28.6% represented hotspots. While the frequency of hotspot mutations in GBM was comparable to cancer types with actionable hotspot alterations, GBMs harbored a higher fraction of subclonal mutations that affected hotspots (7.0%), compared to breast cancer (4.9%), lung cancer (4.4%), and melanoma (1.4%). In investigating the biochemical features of targeted therapies paired with recurring alterations, we identified a trend toward higher lipid solubility and lower IC<sub>50</sub> in GBM cell lines among drugs with clinical efficacy. The drugs' half-life, molecular weight, surface area and binding to efflux transporters were not associated with clinical efficacy. Among the JH MTB cohort of patients with <i>IDH1</i> wild-type high-grade gliomas who received targeted therapies, trametinib monotherapy or in combination with dabrafenib conferred radiographic partial response in 75% of patients harboring <i>BRAF</i> or <i>NF1</i> actionable mutations. Cabozantinib conferred radiographic partial response in two patients harboring a <i>MET</i> and a <i>PDGFRA/KDR</i> amplification. Patients with <i>IDH1</i> wild-type gliomas that harbored actionable alterations who received genotype-matched targeted therapy had longer progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS; 7.37 and 14.72 respectively) than patients whose actionable alterations were not targeted (2.83 and 4.2\u2009months respectively). While multiple host, tumor and drug-related features may limit the delivery and efficacy of targeted therapies for patients with high-grade gliomas, genotype-matched targeted therapies confer favorable clinical outcomes. Further studies are needed to generate more data on the impact of biochemical features of targeted therapies on their clinical efficacy for high-grade gliomas.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Through prospective genomic profiling of 459 consecutive primary treatment-naïve IDH-wildtype glioblastomas in adults, we identified a unique subgroup (2%, 9/459) defined by somatic hypermutation and DNA replication repair deficiency due to biallelic inactivation of a canonical mismatch repair gene. The deleterious mutations in mismatch repair genes were often present in the germline in the heterozygous state with somatic inactivation of the remaining allele, consistent with glioblastomas arising due to underlying Lynch syndrome. A subset of tumors had accompanying proofreading domain mutations in the DNA polymerase POLE and resultant "ultrahypermutation". The median age at diagnosis was 50 years (range 27-78), compared with 63 years for the other 450 patients with conventional glioblastoma (p\u2009<\u20090.01). All tumors had histologic features of the giant cell variant of glioblastoma. They lacked EGFR amplification, lacked combined trisomy of chromosome 7 plus monosomy of chromosome 10, and only rarely had TERT promoter mutation or CDKN2A homozygous deletion, which are hallmarks of conventional IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. Instead, they harbored frequent inactivating mutations in TP53, NF1, PTEN, ATRX, and SETD2 and recurrent activating mutations in PDGFRA. DNA methylation profiling revealed they did not align with known reference adult glioblastoma methylation classes, but instead had unique globally hypomethylated epigenomes and mostly classified as "Diffuse pediatric-type high grade glioma, RTK1 subtype, subclass A". Five patients were treated with immune checkpoint blockade, four of whom survived greater than 3\xa0years. The median overall survival was 36.8 months, compared to 15.5 months for the other 450 patients (p\u2009<\u20090.001). We conclude that "De novo replication repair deficient glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype" represents a biologically distinct subtype in the adult population that may benefit from prospective identification and treatment with immune checkpoint blockade.\n\nConsider:\n1.

This review summarizes the current role of molecular profiling and targeted therapies for gliomas. Molecular profiling is an integral part of the 2021 WHO classification of gliomas. Progress in the development of targeted therapies remains limited due to many factors including the presence of the blood-brain barrier and issues of tumor heterogeneity. Nonetheless, advances have been made with the IDH1/2 inhibitor vorasidenib for IDH-mutant grade 2 gliomas, the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib for BRAFV600E mutated gliomas, and the therapies for subsets of patients with fusions and H3K27M-altered diffuse midline gliomas. While there has been progress in the use of molecular profiling for the classification and treatment of gliomas, much work remains for targeted therapies to realize their potential.\n\nConsider:\n1.

However, in multiple solid tumor types overexpression and/or activating mutations of the <i>EGFR</i> gene frequently occur, thus hijacking the EGFR signaling pathway to promote tumorigenesis. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors in particular often contain prevalent and shared EGFR mutations that provide an ideal source for public neoantigens (NeoAg). Studies in both humans and animal models have confirmed the immunogenicity of some of these NeoAg peptides, suggesting that they may constitute viable targets for cancer immunotherapies. Peptide vaccines targeting mutated EGFR have been tested in multiple clinical trials, demonstrating an excellent safety profile and encouraging clinical efficacy. For example, the CDX-110 (rindopepimut) NeoAg peptide vaccine derived from the EGFRvIII deletion mutant in combination with temozolomide and radiotherapy has shown efficacy in treating EGFRvIII-harboring glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients undergone surgery in multiple Phase I and II clinical trials. Furthermore, pilot clinical trials that have administered personalized NeoAg peptides for treating advanced-stage NSCLC patients have shown this approach to be a feasible and safe method to increase antitumor immune responses. Amongst the vaccine peptides administered, EGFR mutation-targeting NeoAgs induced the strongest T cell-mediated immune responses in patients and were also associated with objective clinical responses, implying a promising future for NeoAg peptide vaccines for treating NSCLC patients with selected EGFR mutations. The efficacy of NeoAg-targeting peptide vaccines may be further improved by combining with other modalities such as tyrosine kinase or immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy, which are currently being tested in animal models and clinical trials. Herein, we review the most current basic and clinical research progress on EGFR-targeted peptide vaccination for the treatment of NSCLC and other solid tumor types.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Our goal was to characterize the clinicopathological features and molecular signatures of the full spectrum of ROS1 fusion-positive gliomas across all age groups. Through a retrospective multi-institutional collaboration, we report a collection of unpublished ROS1 fusion gliomas along with the characterization and meta-analysis of new and published cases. A cohort of 32 new and 58 published cases was divided into the following 3 age groups: 19 infants, 40 pediatric patients, and 31 adults with gliomas. Tumors in infants and adults showed uniformly high-grade morphology; however, tumors in pediatric patients exhibited diverse histologic features. The GOPC::ROS1 fusion was prevalent (61/79, 77%) across all age groups, and 10 other partner genes were identified. Adult tumors showed recurrent genomic alterations characteristic of IDH wild-type glioblastoma, including the\xa0+7/-10/CDKN2A deletion; amplification of CDK4, MDM2, and PDGFRA genes; and mutations involving TERTp, TP53, PIK3R1, PIK3CA, PTEN, and NF1 genes. Infant tumors showed few genomic alterations, whereas pediatric tumors showed moderate genomic complexity. The outcomes were significantly poorer in adult patients. Although not statistically significant, tumors in infant and pediatric patients with high-grade histology and in hemispheric locations appeared more aggressive than tumors with lower grade histology or those in nonhemispheric locations. In conclusion, this study is the largest to date to characterize the clinicopathological and molecular signatures of ROS1 fusion-positive gliomas from infant, pediatric, and adult patients. We conclude that ROS1 likely acts as a driver in infant and pediatric gliomas and as a driver or codriver in adult gliomas. Integrated comprehensive clinical testing might be helpful in identifying such patients for possible targeted therapy.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

This may guide a molecularly targeted strategy for the treatment of glioblastoma (GBM). We retrospectively analysed data obtained using FoundationOne®CDx in a large cohort of IDH1/2 wild-type GBM. We aimed to 1) identify potentially actionable molecular alterations at diagnosis and/or recurrence based on ESMO Scale for Clinical Actionability of Molecular Targets (ESCAT) defined categories of targetability, 2) understand the clinical implications of NGS in terms of access to and activity of targeted therapies. In 442 samples, an NGS profile was available in 98.2%. The median time from diagnosis to NGS profiling was 7.4 months (interquartile range (IQR): 3.4-13.2). Although about half of the patients had at least one actionable molecular alteration, only 3.4% of them were classified as ESCAT IB-IC and 6.7% as ESCAT IIB. Only 36 patients (10.5%) received personalised treatment in clinical trials or as off-label/compassionate use from second-line (median line 3). Most patients did not receive targeted therapy due to clinical deterioration/death (49.6%). Patients treated with dabrafenib/trametinib (9 patients) had the highest disease control rate of 77% and an objective response rate of 22%, with a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 5.2 months. No complete/partial responses were seen with the other regimens. 4/9 (44.4%) patients on anti-BRAF/anti-MEK, 2/4 patients (50%) on erdafitinib and 1/1 patient on capmatinib had a PFS ratio >\xa01.3. One recurrent GBM patient with ROS1-GOCP fusion maintained a complete response for 11.3 months on entrectinib. Our study demonstrated the feasibility of NGS in GBM samples. As the number of clinically relevant targets was limited and only a small group of GBM patients were treated with targeted therapy, NGS testing should be performed in the context of clinical trials. Our results support the activity of anti-BRAF/anti-MEK, while for the other agents prospective study results are needed to draw solid conclusions.\n\nConsider:\n1.

However, **PD-L1 expression was inversely correlated with IDH1 (R132H) mutations (p < 0.05)**, suggesting that IDH1-mutant gliomas may have lower PD-L1 expression and potentially reduced responsiveness to PD-L1-targeted immunotherapy.  \n\n**Methodology:** A **retrospective study** analyzed **45 glioma cases (grades 2–4)** using **immunohistochemistry (IHC)** to assess PD-L1 and IDH1 (R132H) expression. **Statistical analysis** included a **Chi-square test (p < 0.05 significance threshold)** using SPSS software.  \n\n**Population characteristics:** The study included **36 GBM (grade 4) and 9 grade 2 gliomas** from a **tertiary care hospital** over two years. Clinical data such as **age, sex, and tumor location** were collected.  \n\n**Key statistical results:** **PD-L1 was expressed in 73.3% of gliomas**, with no significant correlation to tumor grade. However, **PD-L1 expression was significantly lower in IDH1-mutant tumors (p < 0.05)**.  \n\n**Clinical implications:** The findings suggest that **PD-L1 is a relevant immunotherapy target in GBM**, but its expression may be influenced by IDH1 status. IDH1-mutant tumors may be **less responsive to PD-L1 inhibitors**, highlighting the need for personalized immunotherapy strategies. These results support further research into **combination therapies** integrating immunotherapy with other targeted approaches based on tumor mutation profiles.\n\nArticle PMID:39864140\nThis study investigated the impact of **IDH1 mutations** on immune checkpoint expression and potential treatment strategies in **glioblastoma (GBM)** using two independent **TCGA NGS datasets** (n = 577, n = 153). **Mutation and RNA sequencing analyses** were conducted via **cBioPortal**, while **miRNA expression** was assessed using **miRDB and miRabel**. **Survival analysis** was performed using **Kaplan-Meier estimates**.\n\n### **Key Findings**:\n1. **IDH1 mutations (IDH1^Mu^) were present in 5.4% of GBMs** (range: 4-31% across cohorts) and were **associated with improved overall survival (OS)** (**p = 8.235e-5**).\n2. **PDCD1 (PD-1) and CD274 (PD-L1) were highly expressed in both IDH1^Mu^ and IDH1^Wt^ tumors** (**p < 0.0001**), with **higher expression linked to worse survival** (**PDCD1: p = 0.009, CD274: p = 0.02**).\n3. **Distinct molecular profiles** were identified:\n   - **IDH1^Wt^ GBMs**: Upregulation of **PTEN**, downregulation of **MUC16**.\n   - **IDH1^Mu^ GBMs**: Upregulation of **PIK3R1**, a key **PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway regulator**.\n4. **PIK3R1 and ITGB2 emerged as potential druggable targets**.\n\n### **Clinical Implications**:\n- **Immunotherapy (e.g., PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors) may be beneficial in both IDH1^Mu^ and IDH1^Wt^ GBMs**, given high checkpoint expression.\n- **IDH1^Mu^ GBMs may require combination therapy** with **PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors** due to **PIK3R1 overexpression**.\n- Findings suggest **targeted therapies should be stratified based on IDH1 status** to optimize treatment responses.\n\nThis study underscores the **complex interplay between IDH1 mutations, immune checkpoint expression, and molecular pathways**, highlighting the need for **personalized therapeutic approaches** in GBM.\n\nArticle PMID:39835141\n### Summary:\n\n#### **Main Findings and Conclusions:**  \nThis study identifies a new glioblastoma (GBM) subgroup, G3/MMR, characterized by mismatch repair (MMR) deficiencies and high tumor mutation burden (TMB). These tumors, associated with Lynch syndrome, exhibit distinct molecular and histological features and have significantly worse survival outcomes. Notably, one patient treated with nivolumab-ipilimumab checkpoint inhibitors had an extended survival, suggesting potential efficacy of immunotherapy in this subgroup.\n\n#### **Methodology Overview:**  \nA prospective cohort of 218 GBM patients was analyzed using an integrated clinical, histologic, and molecular approach based on the G1-G7 classification system, which stratifies tumors by MAPK pathway activation. The study identified five patients with germline MMR mutations, assigning them to the newly defined G3/MMR subgroup.\n\n#### **Population Characteristics:**  \n- **Total cohort:** 218 GBM patients  \n- **G3/MMR subgroup:** 5 patients with germline MMR mutations (Lynch syndrome)  \n- **Comparison groups:** G1/EGFR, G3/NF1, and the rest of the cohort  \n\n#### **Key Statistical Results:**  \n- **Median survival for G3/MMR patients:** 3.25 months post-surgery (significantly worse than other subgroups).  \n- **Genomic features of G3/MMR tumors:** High TMB, *MSH2/MSH6* alterations, biallelic *TP53* Arg mutations, and co-occurring *PIK3CA* p.R88Q and *PTEN* alterations.  \n- **Immunotherapy response:** One G3/MMR patient treated with nivolumab-ipilimumab had an improved survival, suggesting potential benefit.  \n\n#### **Clinical Implications:**  \n- G3/MMR GBMs represent a high-risk subgroup with poor prognosis, necessitating aggressive management.  \n- Immunotherapy (nivolumab-ipilimumab) may be a promising treatment for these patients, warranting further investigation.  \n- Molecular profiling, including MMR status and TMB assessment, is critical for guiding treatment decisions in GBM.\n\nArticle PMID:39684714\nThis study analyzed molecular profiles of 131 diffuse glioma patients using next-generation sequencing (Illumina, 812-gene panel) to assess the impact of genetic alterations on prognosis and treatment response.

This molecular classification could enhance treatment personalization and improve prognosis for GBM patients.\n\nArticle PMID:39030304\n### Summary  \n\nThis study investigates how mutations in key glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) proteins—EGFR, IDH1, PTEN, and TP53—affect the presentation of immunogenic epitopes and influence CD8 T cell recognition, with implications for immunotherapy.  \n\n#### **Methodology Overview**  \nUsing in silico tools, researchers analyzed Class I MHC binding for wild-type and mutated proteins via the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB). Peptide-MHC (pMHC-I) models were generated in HLA-arena, followed by hierarchical clustering based on electrostatic surface features. Molecular dynamics simulations (100 ns) were conducted for selected wild-type/mutant peptide pairs to assess structural stability and immune recognition potential.  \n\n#### **Main Findings & Key Statistical Results**  \n- TP53 mutations significantly altered epitope presentation, affecting CD8 T cell recognition.  \n- Certain mutated peptides retained their ability to bind MHC-I and trigger immune responses.  \n- Structural analysis identified specific point mutations that influence peptide presentation, with clustering revealing electrostatic differences between wild-type and mutant complexes.  \n\n#### **Clinical Implications**  \nFindings suggest that some GBM mutations may impair immune recognition, potentially reducing immunotherapy effectiveness. However, identified peptides that maintain CD8 T cell response could serve as targets for peptide-based or mRNA vaccine development, offering new avenues for GBM treatment. Further validation in clinical settings is needed to assess their therapeutic potential.\n\nArticle PMID:38890658\nThis study identified and validated two molecular subtypes of IDH1-wildtype glioblastoma (IDHwt-GBM) using multiomics clustering of 184 TCGA patients, incorporating mRNA, lncRNA, and mutation data. The classification was confirmed across five independent datasets, and predictive models were developed using machine learning and MRI data.  \n\nKey findings:  \n- **Survival differences**: Class 2 had better overall survival than Class 1 (TCGA HR = 1.68 [1.15-2.47]), with validation in multiple cohorts (e.g., CGGA HR = 1.75 [1.04-2.94], CPTAC HR = 1.79 [1.09-2.91]).  \n- **Treatment response**: Class 2 was more sensitive to radiotherapy plus temozolomide, validated in the GLASS cohort.  \n- **Mutation and immune environment**: Class 2 had more DNA mismatch repair defects (P = 0.0021) and distinct immune-related pathway activation (e.g., PD-1, JAK-STAT, ferroptosis).  \n\n### Clinical Implications:  \n- **Personalized treatment**: Molecular subtyping could guide therapy selection, with Class 2 potentially benefiting more from standard chemoradiotherapy.  \n- **Targeted approaches**: Differences in immune pathways suggest potential for immunotherapy strategies tailored to subtype-specific tumor microenvironments.  \n- **Prognostic modeling**: The developed survival prediction model integrating molecular subtypes, age, and sex demonstrated clinical utility and is available via an interactive online tool.  \n\nThese findings support the role of molecular subtyping in optimizing GBM treatment, particularly regarding mutation-driven therapy responses and immunotherapy potential.\n\nArticle PMID:38404571\n### Focused Summary: Impact of GBM Mutations on Treatment Effectiveness  \n\n#### **Main Findings & Conclusions:**  \nThis study examined the prognostic impact of *MGMT* methylation, *TERT* promoter mutation, and immune checkpoint markers (CD47, TIGIT) in adult diffuse gliomas (ADG), including glioblastoma (GBM). Key findings include:  \n- High CD47 and TIGIT expression were significantly associated with *MGMT* unmethylation and poor prognosis.  \n- *MGMT* unmethylation correlated with reduced overall survival in astrocytoma.  \n- CD47, TIGIT, and CD47/TIGIT expression were independent predictors of worse survival in ADG and GBM.  \n- Patients with high CD47 and TIGIT expression may benefit from anti-CD47 and TIGIT immunotherapies.  \n\n#### **Methodology Overview:**  \n- **Study Design:** Retrospective analysis of ADG patients using immunohistochemistry.  \n- **Biomarkers Assessed:** *MGMT* methylation, *TERT* promoter mutation, CD47, and TIGIT expression.  \n- **Statistical Analysis:** Survival outcomes were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariate Cox regression.  \n\n#### **Population Characteristics:**  \n- Included patients with astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, and GBM.  \n- Tumor samples were compared to normal brain tissues.  \n\n#### **Key Statistical Results:**  \n- CD47 and TIGIT expression were significantly higher in GBM than in normal brain tissue.  \n- *MGMT* unmethylation was associated with worse survival in astrocytoma (p < 0.05).  \n- High CD47 and TIGIT expression significantly reduced survival in ADG and GBM (p < 0.05).  \n- *MGMT* unmethylation and high CD47 expression were independent predictors of poor prognosis in ADG.  \n\n#### **Clinical Implications:**  \n- *MGMT* methylation status remains a key predictor of treatment response, particularly for alkylating agents.  \n- High CD47 and TIGIT expression suggest potential resistance to standard therapies, supporting exploration of anti-CD47 and TIGIT immunotherapies.  \n- These findings reinforce the need for personalized treatment approaches in GBM, integrating molecular profiling for optimal therapeutic strategies.\n\nProvide a comprehensive synthesis that:\n1.

We analyzed the frequency of PD-L1 expression in glioma samples. Methodology In this two-year retrospective study, 45 glioma cases of varying grades (grades 2 to 4) were examined at a tertiary care hospital. Tumor samples that were formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) were obtained from the pathology archives of the hospital. According to the WHO Classification of Central Nervous System Tumors, 5th edition, tumor grading and histopathological subtyping were carried out. PD-L1 antibody (clone 28-8) and IDH1 (R132H, clone QM002, Quartett Immunodiagnostika, 1:100 dilution) markers were used for immunohistochemistry (IHC). The sections underwent deparaffinization, rehydration, and antigen retrieval using Leica bond III staining platform. Based on the tumor proportion score (TPS), which is the proportion of viable tumor cells with membranous staining, PD-L1 expression was assessed.

We analyzed the frequency of PD-L1 expression in glioma samples. Methodology In this two-year retrospective study, 45 glioma cases of varying grades (grades 2 to 4) were examined at a tertiary care hospital. Tumor samples that were formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) were obtained from the pathology archives of the hospital. According to the WHO Classification of Central Nervous System Tumors, 5th edition, tumor grading and histopathological subtyping were carried out. PD-L1 antibody (clone 28-8) and IDH1 (R132H, clone QM002, Quartett Immunodiagnostika, 1:100 dilution) markers were used for immunohistochemistry (IHC). The sections underwent deparaffinization, rehydration, and antigen retrieval using Leica bond III staining platform. Based on the tumor proportion score (TPS), which is the proportion of viable tumor cells with membranous staining, PD-L1 expression was assessed. The literature's standardized cut-off values were used to determine positive expression. Staining intensity and tumor cell location were used to determine the status of IDH1 mutations. Age, sex, and tumor location were among the clinical and demographic information gathered about the patient.

Here, we characterized 5 murine GBM stem-like cell (mGSC) models derived from lentivirus-induced tumors in transgenic mice that are driven by the activation of the Nf1-Ras signaling pathway and inactivation of Tp53. MGSC lines (005, RIG, NF53, C1, and C3) were cultured as spheres in serum-free stem cell media. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was employed to quantify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Stem cell properties were characterized by stemness in vitro and tumorigenicity after intracerebral implantation in C57BL/6 mice. Tumor phenotypes and the immune microenvironment were characterized by immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and RNA sequencing. WES revealed a large variation in coding sequence SNPs across mGSC lines (~20-fold), likely influenced by the mixed backgrounds of the parental mice. MGSCs exhibited variable clonogenic sphere formation and CD133 expression levels. In vivo, they consistently initiated lethal malignant gliomas, with median survival ranging from 29 to 82 days, and showed strong CD44 expression and variable invasiveness. The tumor microenvironment featured an abundance of CD68+ macrophages and uniform high PD-L1+ myeloid cells, while T-cell infiltration varied among the models, with low mutation burden C1 and C3 exhibiting fewer tumor-infiltrating T cells. Upon orthotopic implantation in immunocompetent mice, mGSCs generate tumors characteristic of human GBM. Despite similar strategies to generate these mGSCs, they exhibited a range of phenotypes and immune profiles in mGSC-derived orthotopic tumors. These mGSCs provide new preclinical GBM models for developing GBM immunotherapies.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2. Study type and methodology\n3. Population characteristics\n4.

Non-canonical mutations such as BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>, found in 1-2% of GBMs, activate the MEK-ERK signaling pathway. This mutation can be targeted by small molecule inhibitors, offering therapeutic potential for GBM. In this case report, we describe the management of a 67-year-old male with BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> -mutant GBM, who experienced both local clonal and distant non-clonal BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> -mutant recurrences. Initial treatment involved surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and temozolomide (TMZ). Subsequent recurrences were managed with re-resection and dabrafenib/trametinib combination therapy. Notably, a new, non-clonal BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> -negative tumor developed in a distant location, highlighting the challenge of clonal evolution and resistance in GBM management. The patient's disease ultimately progressed despite multiple lines of therapy, including targeted inhibition. Identifying mechanisms of resistance and tailoring flexible treatment approaches are essential for advancing outcomes in BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> -mutant GBM. This case emphasizes the value of molecular profiling in personalizing treatment for patients with multifocal disease. The evolving nature of these tumors requires persistent clinical monitoring and treatment adjustments based on tissue diagnostics.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

Although the survival is generally dismal for glioblastoma patients, risk stratification and the identification of high-risk subgroups is important for prompt and aggressive management. The G1-G7 molecular subgroup classification based on the MAPK pathway activation has offered for the first time a non-redundant, all-inclusive classification of adult glioblastoma. Five patients from the large, 218-patient, prospective cohort showed germline mutations in mismatch repair (MMR) genes (Lynch syndrome) and a significantly worse median survival of 3.25 months post-surgery than those from the G1/EGFR and G3/NF1 major subgroups, or from the rest of the cohort adjusted for age. These rare tumors were assigned to a new subgroup, G3/MMR, a G3/NF1 subgroup spin-off, as they generally show genomic alterations leading to RAS activation, such as <i>NF1</i> and <i>PTPN11</i> mutations. An integrated clinical, histologic and molecular analysis of the G3/MMR tumors showed distinct characteristics as compared to other glioblastomas, including those with iatrogenic high tumor mutation burden (TMB), warranting a separate subgroup. Prior history of cancer, midline location or multifocality, presence of multinucleated giant cells (MGCs), positive p53 and MMR immunohistochemistry, and specific molecular characteristics, including high TMB, <i>MSH2</i>/<i>MSH6</i> alterations, biallelic <i>TP53</i> Arg mutations and co-occurring <i>PIK3CA</i> p.R88Q and <i>PTEN</i> alterations, alert to this high-risk G3/MMR subgroup. The MGCs and p53 immunohistochemistry analysis in G1-G7 subgroups showed that one in 7 tumors with these characteristics is a G3/MMR glioblastoma.

However, O6-MeG repair by O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) contributes to drug resistance. Characterizing genomic profiles of O6-MeG could elucidate how O6-MeG accumulation is influenced by repair, but there are no methods to map genomic locations of O6-MeG. Here, we developed an immunoprecipitation- and polymerase-stalling-based method, termed O6-MeG-seq, to locate O6-MeG across the whole genome at single-nucleotide resolution. We analyzed O6-MeG formation and repair across sequence contexts and functional genomic regions in relation to MGMT expression in a glioblastoma-derived cell line. O6-MeG signatures were highly similar to mutational signatures from patients previously treated with temozolomide. Furthermore, MGMT did not preferentially repair O6-MeG with respect to sequence context, chromatin state or gene expression level, however, may protect oncogenes from mutations. Finally, we found an MGMT-independent strand bias in O6-MeG accumulation in highly expressed genes. These data provide high resolution insight on how O6-MeG formation and repair are impacted by genome structure and nucleotide sequence. Further, O6-MeG-seq is expected to enable future studies of DNA modification signatures as diagnostic markers for addressing drug resistance and preventing secondary cancers.\n\nConsider:\n1.

The HGG patients following surgery and treatment with radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses were used to assess the independent prognostic factors. The nomogram model was established, and its accuracy was determined via the calibration plots. A total of 215 and 88 patients had grade III glioma and grade IV glioma, respectively. Grade III oligodendroglioma (OG-G3) patients had the longest mPFS and mOS than other grade III pathology, while grade III astrocytoma (AA-G3) patients were close to IDH-1 wildtype glioblastoma (GBM) and had a poor prognosis. The IDH-1 mutant group had a better mPFS and mOS than the IDH-1 wildtype group in all grade III patients, OG-G3 and AA-G3 patients. Furthermore, 1p/19q co-deletion group had a longer mPFS and mOS than 1p/19q non-deletion group in all grade III patients. IDH-1 mutation and 1p/19q co-deletion patients had the best prognosis than other molecular types. Also, the MGMT methylation and IDH-1 mutation or 1p/19q co-deletion group had a longer mPFS and mOS than the MGMT unmethylation and IDH-1 wildtype or 1p/19q non-codeletion of grade III patients. In addition, the low Ki-67 expression group had a better prognosis than high Ki-67 expression group in grade III patients. Univariate and multivariate COX showed that 1p/19q co-deletion and MGMT methylation were the independent prognostic factors for mPFS and mOS. The calibration curve showed that the established nomogram could well predict the survival based on these covariates. The AA-G3 with IDH-1 wildtype, MGMT unmethylation or 1p/19q non-codeletion patients was resistant to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, has a poor prognosis and needs a more active treatment.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Disruption of the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway in tumor cells enhances the effectiveness of radiotherapy drugs, while increased mutational burden following tumor cell damage also facilitates the efficacy of immunotherapy. The ATRX gene, located on chromosome X, plays a crucial role in DDR. The aim of this research is to elucidate the correlation between ATRX mutations and GBM. Dataset obtained from TCGA-GBM were conducted an analysis on the genomic features, biological characteristics, immunopathological markers, and clinical prognosis of patients carrying ATRX mutations. Our findings revealed a significantly elevated level of microsatellite instability in individuals with ATRX mutants, along with significant alterations in the receptor-tyrosine kinase (RTK)-ras pathway among patients exhibiting combined ATRX mutations. TCGA-GBM patients with concurrent ATRX mutations exhibited sensitivity to 26 chemotherapeutic and anticancer drugs, which exerted their effects by modulating the DDR of tumor cells through highly correlated mechanisms involving the RTK-ras pathway. Additionally, we observed an enrichment of ATRX mutations in specific pathways associated with DDR among TCGA-GBM patients. Our model also demonstrated prolonged overall survival in patients carrying ATRX mutations, particularly showing strong predictive value for 3- and 5-year survival rates. Furthermore, additional protective factors such as younger age, female gender, combined IDH mutations, and TP53 mutations were identified. The results underscore the protective role and prognostic significance of ATRX mutations in GBM as a potential therapeutic target and biomarker for patient survival.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Aberrant expression of RNF7 has been observed in various tumor types and is known to significantly influence tumor initiation and progression. However, the specific role of RNF7 in glioblastoma remains unclear. IDH (isocitrate dehydrogenase) mutations, which induce metabolic reprogramming and result in notable heterogeneity among glioma with different IDH genotypes. Through analysis of public glioma databases, we identified a high expression of RNF7 in glioma and its correlation with patient prognosis. Moreover, we observed variations in RNF7 expression and its association with patient outcomes under different treatment modalities among different IDH genotypes. In this study, we demonstrated the critical role of RNF7 in the malignant phenotype of IDH1-mutant glioma and its contribution to radiation resistance. Subsequent functional enrichment analysis of RNF7 in glioma, coupled with validation through cellular experiments, confirmed its significant involvement in maintaining redox balance. Our findings suggest that RNF7 exerts a buffering effect against radiation-induced oxidative stress and counterbalances the redox stress induced by IDH1 mutation through its anti-ROS activity. Additionally, our follow-up investigations revealed that the upregulation of RNF7 after radiation exposure and in IDH1-mutant glioma cells is induced by ROS. Collectively, our study underscores the potential of RNF7 as a molecular biomarker in glioma. Elevated RNF7 expression often indicates a heightened metabolic resilience in glioma, leading to resistance against radiotherapy.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

The heterogeneity of GBM complicates diagnosis and treatment, driving research into molecular biomarkers that can offer insights into tumor behavior and guide personalized therapies. This review explores recent advances in molecular biomarkers, highlighting their potential to improve diagnosis and treatment outcomes in GBM patients. Key biomarkers such as MGMT promoter methylation, IDH1/2 mutations, EGFR amplification, and TERT promoter mutations, etc., are examined for their roles in prognosis, therapeutic response, and tumor classification. While molecular biomarkers offer valuable insights for tailoring GBM treatments, their clinical application is hindered by tumor heterogeneity, dynamic genetic evolution, and the lack of standardized testing methods. Future research should aim to confirm new biomarkers and incorporate them into regular clinical practice to improve prognosis and treatment choices. Advances in genomic and proteomic technologies, along with consistent biomarker detection, could transform GBM care and enhance patient outcomes.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

To explore the relationship between MRI perfusion metrics (rCBV, rCBF), genetic markers, and contrast enhancement patterns in gliomas, aiming to enhance diagnostic accuracy and inform personalized therapeutic strategies. Additionally, other radiological features, such as the T2/FLAIR mismatch sign, are evaluated for their predictive utility in IDH mutations. Retrospective cohort study. 67 patients with brain tumors (including glioblastoma, astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma) undergoing surgical resection. 1.5 Tesla MRI, including T1 pre- and post-contrast, FLAIR, DWI, and DSC sequences. Semiquantitative perfusion metrics (rCBV, rCBF) were evaluated against genetic markers (IDH1, EGFR, CDKN2A, PDGFRA, MGMT, TERT, 1p19q, PTEN, TP53, H3F3A) through advanced MRI techniques. Contrast enhancement was assessed, and genetic alterations were confirmed via histopathological and molecular analyses. Chi-square test, sensitivity, specificity, and ROC analysis for predictive modeling; significance level set at p\xa0<\xa00.05. Statistically significant differences in perfusion metrics were observed among tumors with distinct genetic profiles, with primary tumors and those harboring specific mutations (IDH1 wildtype, EGFR amplification, CDKN2A homozygous deletion, PDGFRA amplification) showing higher perfusion values. A cut-off value of <4 for rCBV in predicting IDH1 mutation yielded a sensitivity of 61.5\xa0% and specificity of 82.1\xa0%. For CDKN2A deletion, a cut-off of >5 resulted in a sensitivity of 75\xa0% and specificity of 74.6\xa0%, with an ROC value of 0.78. Integrating perfusion MRI with genetic analysis offers a promising approach to improving the diagnostic and therapeutic landscape for brain tumors, indicating a substantial step toward personalized neuro-oncology. Additionally, findings like the T2/FLAIR mismatch sign highlight the potential for preoperative molecular predictions when biopsy is not feasible. These findings support further validation in larger, multi-institutional studies to solidify their role in clinical practice.

Personalized treatment based on molecular markers may help improve the prognosis. We aimed to evaluate whether apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) histogram analysis can better predict MGMT and TERT molecular characteristics and to determine the prognostic relevance of genetic profile in patients with GBM. MRI, clinical, and pathological data of 79 patients with GBM were retrospectively collected. The ADC values based on histogram analysis were described using 10th percentile (p10), 90th percentile (p90), mean, median, minimum, maximum, skewness, kurtosis, and entropy. The independent-sample t test, linear correlation analysis, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and Cox proportional hazard regression were performed. MGMT promoter methylation and TERT promoter mutation were detected in 53.2% and 44.3% of GBM patients, respectively. The ADC<sub>p10</sub> in MGMT promoter unmethylated group was significantly lower than that in the MGMT promoter methylated group (p\xa0=\xa00.005). There were significant differences in ADC<sub>min</sub>, ADC<sub>p10</sub>, ADC<sub>mean</sub>, and entropy between TERT promoter mutant and wild-type groups. Entropy showed the best diagnostic performance in differentiating between positive and negative TERT groups (AUC\xa0=\xa00.722, p\xa0=\xa00.001). Overall survival (OS) showed a positive correlation with ADC<sub>min</sub>. The TERT promoter mutation was the only independent prognostic factor for GBM. ADC histogram analysis may be a potential noninvasive biomarker for differentiating MGMT and TERT molecular markers and providing prognostic information for GBM patients.\n\nConsider:\n1.

The molecular profile of adult PLG has not been well-characterized. We report the clinical, pathological, and molecular findings of six adult PLG patients (five males and one female), median age 58\u2009years. All cases exhibited pathological leptomeningeal enhancement at presentation. Leptomeningeal biopsy was diagnostic in five (of six) cases, revealing infiltration by an astrocytic glioma with mitotic activity, lacking microvascular proliferation or necrosis. One case was diagnosed at autopsy. All tumors were IDH-wildtype, with five harboring TERT promoter mutations. Additional mutations identified were PTEN in one case, TP53 in two cases, and NF1 in two cases. A chromosome profile with +7/-10 was found in four cases, whereas the remaining two showed either chromosome 7 or 7p gain only. Four cases showed chromosome 9p loss with CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion, one case showed hemizygous CDKN2A/B loss, and one case showed intact chromosome 9 and CDK4/GLI1 amplification. DNA methylation profiling was performed in four cases and revealed a match to glioblastoma (GBM) family and mesenchymal typical class with high confidence scores in two cases; the other two cases showed only suggestive combined scores for GBM family and mesenchymal atypical class. The molecular profile of all cases closely aligned with that of adult-type GBM, IDH-wildtype, CNS WHO grade 4. All patients succumbed to the disease. In five cases with extensive leptomeningeal disease at diagnosis, the course was rapid, with median survival of 24\u2009days following palliative care. Only one case, with relatively localized disease at diagnosis, received chemoradiation therapy and survived 535\u2009days, raising the possibility that early diagnosis and timely treatment could improve outcome. A detailed list of previously reported cases is provided in a supplementary table.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2. Study type and methodology\n3. Population characteristics\n4.

Although TP53 mutations are prevalent in glioblastoma (GBM), the mechanisms by which TP53 regulates iron metabolism remain elusive. We reveal an imbalance iron homeostasis in GBM via TCGA database analysis. TP53 mutations disrupted iron homeostasis in GBM, characterized by elevated total iron levels and reduced ferritin (FTH). The gain-of-function effect triggered by TP53 mutations upregulates itchy E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (ITCH) protein expression in astrocytes, leading to FTH degradation and an increase in free iron levels. TP53-mut astrocytes were more tolerant to the high iron environment induced by exogenous ferric ammonium citrate (FAC), but the increase in intracellular free iron made them more sensitive to Erastin-induced ferroptosis. Interestingly, we found that Erastin combined with FAC treatment significantly increased ferroptosis. These findings provide new insights for drug development and therapeutic modalities for GBM patients with TP53 mutations from iron metabolism perspectives.\n\nConsider:\n1.

While some studies suggest a survival advantage for gcGB patients, the underlying causes remain elusive. GcGBs are associated with TP53 mutations, and gcs were shown to accumulate DNA double-strand breaks and show deficient mitosis, potentially triggering cellular senescence programs. Epigenetic clocks have emerged as valuable tools for assessing tumor-induced age acceleration (DNAMethAgeAcc), which has lately proved itself as prognostic biomarker in glioblastoma. Our study aimed to comprehensively analyze the methylome and key metabolic proteins of gcGBs, hypothesizing that they undergo cellular aging programs compared to non-gcGBs. A total of 310 epigenetically classified GBs, including 26 gcGBs, and nine adults with malignant gliomas allocating to pediatric high-grade glioma molecular subclasses (summarized as "pediatric GB") were included. DNAMethAgeAcc was computed by subtraction of chronological patient ages from DNA methylome-derived age estimations and its increase was associated with better survival within gcGB and non-gcGB. GcGBs were significantly more often allocated to the subgroup with increased DNAMethAgeAcc and demonstrated the highest DNAMethAgeAcc. Hypothetical senescence/aging-induced changes of the tumor microenvironment were addressed by tumor deconvolution, which was able to identify a cluster enriched for tumors with increased DNAMethAgeAcc. Key metabolic protein expression did not differ between gcGB and non-gcGB and tumor with versus without increased DNAMethAgeAcc but for elevated levels of one single mitochondrial marker, anti-mitochondrial protein MT-C02, in gcGBs. With its sped-up epigenetic aging, gcGB presented as the epigenetic oldest GB variant in our cohort. Whereas the correlation between accelerated tumor-intrinsic epigenetic aging and cellular senescence in gcGB stays elusive, fostering epigenetic aging programs in GB might be of interest for future exploration of alternative treatment options in GB patients.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Using gene editing protocol based on CRISPR-Cas 9 with cytidine deaminase, we introduced point mutations into U87MG glioblastoma cells to establish modified cell lines with heterozygous IDH1 R132H, homozygous TP53 R248Q and heterozygous IDH1 R132H, homozygous TP53 R248Q genotypes. A comparative study of cell migration on major ECM components was carried out by high-content microscopy. IDH1 R132H mutation introduced to U87MG glioblastoma cells was shown to decrease the migration speed on Matrigel and collagen IV substrates compared to the wild-type. This data were supported by cell adhesion quantification via the lateral shift assay performed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). TP53 R248Q mutation increased cell adhesion to various substrates and significantly promoted cell migration on hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate but did not change the migration rates on laminin and collagens IV and I. A double-mutant genotype produced by consequently introducing IDH1 R132H and TP53 R248Q to parental glioblastoma cells was characterized by the highest migration among all the cell lines, with particularly faster motility on chondroitin sulfate. These findings underscore the complex interactions between glioma cells, with the most important driver mutations and specific ECM components regulating cancer cell migration, offering valuable insights for potential therapeutic targets in glioma treatment.\n\nConsider:\n1.

This subtype is associated with significant heterogeneity, chemoresistance, early recurrence, metastasis, and poor patient survival. FOXM1 is a cancer-promoting transcription factor that plays a critical role in TNBC and other highly aggressive cancers by driving cell proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance. In TNBC, mutations in the TP53 gene-detected in approximately 80% of patients-lead to the overexpression of FOXM1, making it a promising therapeutic target. Beyond TNBC, FOXM1 is implicated in other solid cancers, such as brain (glioblastoma), lung, and pancreatic cancers, and is considered an Achilles' heel of aggressive cancers. Despite its potential as a therapeutic target, there are currently no FDA-approved FOXM1 inhibitors, and none have advanced to clinical trials. This review explores the role of FOXM1 in cancer progression and highlights the current status of efforts to develop effective FOXM1 inhibitors.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from GBM cells contain important biomarkers, such as microRNAs, proteins, and DNA mutations, which are involved in tumor progression, invasion, and resistance to treatment. Identifying surface markers on these EVs is crucial for their isolation and potential use in noninvasive diagnosis. This study aimed to use tumor-derived explants to investigate the surface markers of EVs and explore their role as diagnostic biomarkers for GBM. Tumor explants from nine GBM patients without IDH1/IDH2 mutations or 1p-19q co-deletion were cultured to preserve both tumor viability and cytoarchitecture. EVs were collected from the tumor microenvironment using differential centrifugation, filtration, and membrane affinity binding. Their surface protein composition was analyzed through multiplex protein assays. RNA-Seq data from TCGA and GTEx datasets, along with in silico single-cell RNA-seq data, were used to assess EV surface biomarker expression across large GBM patient cohorts. The in vitro model successfully replicated the tumor microenvironment and produced EVs with distinct surface markers. Biomarker analysis in large datasets revealed specific expression patterns unique to GBM patients compared with healthy controls. These markers demonstrated potential as a GBM-specific signature and were correlated with clinical data. Furthermore, in silico single-cell RNA-seq provided detailed insights into biomarker distribution across different cell types within the tumor. This study underscores the efficacy of the tumor-derived explant model and its potential to advance the understanding of GBM biology and EV production. A key innovation is the isolation of EVs from a model that faithfully mimics the tumor's original cytoarchitecture, offering a deeper understanding of the cells involved in EV release. The identified EV surface markers represent promising targets for enhancing EV isolation and optimizing their use as diagnostic tools. Moreover, further investigation into their molecular cargo may provide crucial insights into tumor characteristics and evolution.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

Approximately 8% of GBM cases exhibit genomic alterations in fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs), particularly FGFR1 and FGFR3. Next-generation sequencing techniques have identified various FGFR3 fusions in GBM. This report presents a novel FGFR3 fusion with fatty acid synthase (FASN) in a 41-year-old male diagnosed with GBM. The patient presented with a persistent headache, and imaging revealed a right frontal lobe lesion. Surgical resection and subsequent histopathology confirmed GBM. Initial NGS analysis showed no mutations in the IDH1, IDH2 or H3F3 genes, but revealed a TERT promoter mutation and CDKN2A/2B and PTEN deletions. Postoperative treatment included radiotherapy and temozolomide. Despite initial management, recurrence occurred four months post-diagnosis, confirmed by MRI and histology. A second surgery identified a novel FGFR3-FASN fusion, alongside increased Ki67 expression. The recurrence was managed with regorafenib and bevacizumab, though complications like hand-foot syndrome and radiation necrosis arose. Despite initial improvement, the patient died 15 months after diagnosis. This case underscores the importance of understanding GBM's molecular landscape for effective treatment strategies. The novel FGFR3-FASN fusion suggests potential implications for GBM recurrence and lipid metabolism. Further studies are warranted to explore FGFR3-FASN's role in GBM and its therapeutic targeting.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2. Study type and methodology\n3.

Despite current therapies, the 5-year survival rate is 5%-10%. The authors report a case with a durable long-term response to immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibition in a patient with LFS-associated GBM. An 18-year-old female presented after a syncopal episode and left leg weakness and was found to have a right frontal tumor. She underwent gross-total resection of the tumor (grade IV giant cell GBM IDH-wildtype, MGMT unmethylated, associated with a p53 germline mutation), radiation, and chemotherapy. On later imaging, increased enhancement was demonstrated, which raised concerns for tumor recurrence, and she underwent stereotactic radiosurgery followed by lomustine and procarbazine. These agents were later replaced with bevacizumab after a second resection, negative for recurrent glioma. Subsequently, nivolumab was added, given concerns for tumor progression, and the patient showed improvement within 5 months. The patient has continued nivolumab monotherapy and has had progression-free survival for more than 7 years. Despite advances in treatment, the median survival of patients with GBM is only 15 months. This case highlights the potential of immunotherapy with PD-L1 checkpoint inhibition in improving outcomes for LFS-associated GBM patients. https://thejns.org/doi/10.3171/CASE24539.\n\nConsider:\n1.

With the aim of facilitating the discrimination of glioblastoma molecular phenotypes and improving the accuracy of molecular imaging diagnosis, the present retrospective study analyzed the association between <i>MGMT</i> promoter methylation and glioblastoma magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) texture features and prognosis. A total of 128 patients with pathologically diagnosed glioblastoma who had undergone preoperative MRI were enrolled. MRI texture features were extracted using 3D Slicer software and their relationship with <i>MGMT</i> promoter methylation was evaluated. In total, seven MRI texture features were significantly different between glioblastomas with methylated and unmethylated <i>MGMT</i> promoters-energy, entropy, uniformity, autocorrelation, and variance in gray level co-occurrence matrix, gray level non-uniformity and cluster shade. Glioblastomas with methylated and unmethylated <i>MGMT</i> promoters differed in tumor location, with the former predominantly located in the temporal lobe [Model I, area under the curve (AUC): 0.697]. Among MRI texture features, variance was significantly different between methylation groups (Model II, AUC: 0.838). Significant overall survival (OS) differences were noticed between patients with methylated and unmethylated <i>MGMT</i> promoters, between patients with preoperative Karnofsky performance status (KPS) scores ≥80 and <80, and among patients with glioblastoma who received radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or concurrent chemoradiotherapy. The seven MRI texture features may serve as independent predictors of prognosis for patients with glioblastoma with methylated <i>MGMT</i> promoters. MRI texture features demonstrated improved and more accurate diagnostic performance than MRI features regarding <i>MGMT</i> promoter methylation status prediction. For patients with glioblastoma with preoperative KPS scores ≥80, those with methylated <i>MGMT</i> promoters had significantly longer OS. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy had a significantly improved prognosis than either radiotherapy or chemotherapy alone. In summary, the present study provided a non-invasive, cost-effective method for detecting <i>MGMT</i> promoter methylation and can significantly contribute to personalized treatment planning for patients with glioblastoma, potentially improving their quality of life.\n\nConsider:\n1.

ALDH1A1 is a primary metabolic enzyme impacting the outcome of chemotherapy, including temozolomide. High expression of ALDH1A1 is associated with poor prognosis in multiple cancers, suggesting PPIs may have a negative impact on survival. Real-world data on GBM patients was annotated from electronic medical records (EMR) according to the prospective observational study, XCELSIOR (NCT03793088). Patients with known <i>IDH1/2</i> mutations were excluded. Causal effects on survival were analyzed using a multivariate, time-varying Cox Proportional Hazard (CPH) model with stratifications including <i>MGMT</i> methylation status, age, sex, duration of corticosteroid use, extent of resection, starting standard-of-care, and PPI use. EMR data from 554 GBM patients across 225 cancer centers was collected, with 72% of patients receiving care from academic medical centers. Patients treated with PPIs (51%) had numerically lower median overall survival (mOS) and 2-year OS rates in the total population and across most strata, with the greatest difference for MGMT-methylated patients (mOS 29.2 vs. 40.1 months). In a time-varying multivariate CPH analysis of the above strata, PPIs caused an adverse effect on survival (HR 1.67 [95% CI: 1.15-2.44], <i>P</i>\u2005=\u2005.007). Evidence from a nationwide cancer registry has suggested PPIs have a negative impact on OS for GBM patients, particularly those with <i>MGMT</i> promoter methylation. This suggests PPIs should be avoided for prophylactic management of gastrointestinal toxicity in patients with GBM receiving chemoradiotherapy.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

In a retrospective single-center study the results of sPDT with 5-ALA in 10 patients (6 of 10 were male), aged 30 to 62 years (median: 51.5 years; 95% CI: 38-59 years) with recurrent malignant brain gliomas after standard therapy who underwent surgery during the period of 2020-2023 were analyzed. sPDT was conducted during 15 min using 5-ALA at a dosage of 20 mg/kg, a diode laser with a wavelength of 635 nm and power of 1 W, and the LFT-02-BIOSPEC unit (BIOSPEC, Russia). Three patients got repeated sPDT after 3, 7, and 15 months due to a relapse. The number of target points and the optimal position for intervention paths were determined according to the data of preoperative stereotactic MRI of the brain with contrast intensification using the CRW Precision stereotactic navigation system (Integra, USA) and intraoperative registration of the area with the highest intensity of protoporphyrin IX fluorescence along the path (according to fluorescence biospectroscopy). Glioblastoma (grade IV, WHO) was diagnosed in 7 patients, anaplastic astrocytoma (grade III, WHO) - in 3 persons. Genetic studies were performed for 9 patients, 7 of them had tumors without the <i>IDH1</i> gene mutation. None of the patients had a combined 1p/19q deletion. The median volume of the contrast-enhancing part of the recurrent tumor was 7.95 cm<sup>3</sup> (95% CI: 3.3-13.6 cm<sup>3</sup>). The median time to relapse after sPDT in patients with anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas was 14.5 and 6.5 months, respectively. The median survival time after sPDT in patients with glioblastomas was 15.8 months (95% CI: 0.5-20.1 months), and in patients with anaplastic astrocytomas - 46.3 months (95%, CI not specified). In the early postoperative period, two patients had motor aphasia and hemiparesis, which further regressed. The results of a small group of patients allow to consider sPDT with 5-ALA as a promising technique to treat patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas in functionally relevant brain areas and require further prospective assessment.\n\nConsider:\n1.

A total of 131 patients with diffuse glioma (18 low-grade glioma [LGG], 113 high-grade glioma [HGG]) underwent tumor-normal sequencing using an 812-gene cancer panel on the Illumina platform.  \n\n### **Key Findings & Conclusions:**  \n- **Mutation Prevalence:**  \n  - **LGG:** IDH1/2 (78%), ATRX (33%), TP53 (44%), PIK3CA (17%), 1p/19q co-deletion (22%).  \n  - **HGG:** CDKN2A/B (33%), TERTp (71%), PTEN (60%), TP53 (27%), EGFR (40%).  \n- **Prognostic Markers:**  \n  - **Better prognosis:** IDH1/2 mutations and lower tumor grade.  \n  - **Worse prognosis:** TERTp mutation and PTEN deletion.  \n  - **IDH-wildtype GBM:** History of prior cancer correlated with lower overall survival (OS).  \n- **Treatment Outcomes:**  \n  - Bevacizumab and re-operation improved OS in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.  \n  - Nine patients received molecular targeted therapy, though specific effectiveness data were not detailed.  \n\n### **Clinical Implications:**  \n- IDH1/2 mutations suggest better prognosis and may influence therapy selection.  \n- TERTp and PTEN alterations indicate poor outcomes, potentially guiding risk stratification.  \n- Bevacizumab may benefit IDH-wildtype GBM patients.  \n- Further research is needed to assess targeted therapy effectiveness.  \n\nThis study underscores the importance of molecular profiling in guiding glioblastoma treatment decisions, including targeted therapies and immunotherapies.\n\nArticle PMID:39560080\nThis study analyzed the molecular evolution of glioblastoma (GBM) in 106 patients by performing histopathologic, genomic, and epigenomic profiling of paired initial and recurrent tumor specimens. Key findings include:\n\n1. **Heterogeneous Genetic Evolution**: While TERT promoter mutations and CDKN2A homozygous deletions were early, stable events, alterations in EGFR, PTEN, and NF1 were often unique to either initial or recurrent tumors, indicating later-stage evolution.\n\n2. **Epigenomic Changes and Treatment Response**: GBMs exhibited diverse epigenomic trajectories—some became globally hypermethylated, others hypomethylated, or remained stable. A subset that developed somatic hypermutation after temozolomide treatment had significantly longer time to recurrence and improved survival. This hypermutation was linked to increased methylation at four specific MGMT promoter CpG sites.\n\n3. **Sarcomatous Transformation and Prognosis**: GBMs undergoing sarcomatous transformation recurred faster and were enriched in NF1, TP53, and RB1 mutations, aligning with a mesenchymal epigenetic profile.\n\n4. **Prognostic Epigenomic Signature**: A DNA methylation-based signature across 347 CpG sites correlated significantly with clinical outcomes.\n\n### **Clinical Implications:**\n- **MGMT Methylation & Temozolomide Response**: Increased MGMT promoter methylation at specific CpG sites predicts hypermutation, which is associated with prolonged survival.\n- **Targeted Therapy Considerations**: Late-stage EGFR, PTEN, and NF1 mutations suggest that recurrent GBMs may require different targeted therapies than primary tumors.\n- **Immunotherapy Implications**: Hypermutation following temozolomide may enhance neoantigen load, potentially improving response to immunotherapies.\n- **Tumor-Treating Fields (TTF)**: The study does not directly address TTF, but the mesenchymal transition in sarcomatous GBMs may influence TTF sensitivity.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nGBM exhibits dynamic genetic and epigenetic evolution, affecting treatment response and prognosis. Understanding these molecular shifts, particularly MGMT methylation and hypermutation, may refine personalized treatment strategies, including chemotherapy, targeted therapies, and immunotherapy.\n\nProvide a comprehensive synthesis that:\n1.

In this study, we employed an integrative multi-omics approach, including targeted proteomics, transcriptomics, genomics, and DNA methylation profiling, to investigate the response of a representative panel of GBM patient-derived cancer stem cells (CSCs) to astrocytic differentiation and RT and TMZ treatments. Differentiated CSC progenies retained the expression of key stemness genes and survival pathways, while activating the BMP-Smad signaling pathway and upregulating extracellular matrix components. This was associated with increased resistance to TMZ, though not to RT, across all models.

Non-canonical mutations such as BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>, found in 1-2% of GBMs, activate the MEK-ERK signaling pathway. This mutation can be targeted by small molecule inhibitors, offering therapeutic potential for GBM. In this case report, we describe the management of a 67-year-old male with BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> -mutant GBM, who experienced both local clonal and distant non-clonal BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> -mutant recurrences. Initial treatment involved surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and temozolomide (TMZ). Subsequent recurrences were managed with re-resection and dabrafenib/trametinib combination therapy. Notably, a new, non-clonal BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> -negative tumor developed in a distant location, highlighting the challenge of clonal evolution and resistance in GBM management. The patient's disease ultimately progressed despite multiple lines of therapy, including targeted inhibition. Identifying mechanisms of resistance and tailoring flexible treatment approaches are essential for advancing outcomes in BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> -mutant GBM. This case emphasizes the value of molecular profiling in personalizing treatment for patients with multifocal disease. The evolving nature of these tumors requires persistent clinical monitoring and treatment adjustments based on tissue diagnostics.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

In the following 20 years, it has lived up to expectations. A substantial body of evidence has demonstrated that it is closely related to the development, metastasis, migration, and drug resistance of malignant tumors. In recent years, research on the MSI protein has advanced, and many novel viewpoints and drug resistance attempts have been derived; for example, tumor protein p53 mutations and MSI-binding proteins lead to resistance to protein arginine N-methyltransferase 5-targeted therapy in lymphoma patients. Moreover, the high expression of MSI2 in pancreatic cancer might suppress its development and progression. As a significant member of the MSI family, MSI2 is closely associated with multiple malignant tumors, including hematological disorders, common abdominal tumors, and other tumor types (e.g., glioblastoma, breast cancer). MSI2 is highly expressed in the majority of tumors and is related to a poor disease prognosis. However, its specific expression levels and regulatory mechanisms may differ based on the tumor type. This review summarizes the research progress related to MSI2 in recent years, including its occurrence, migration mechanism, and drug resistance, as well as the prospect of developing tumor immunosuppressants and biomarkers.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Although the survival is generally dismal for glioblastoma patients, risk stratification and the identification of high-risk subgroups is important for prompt and aggressive management.

These rare tumors were assigned to a new subgroup, G3/MMR, a G3/NF1 subgroup spin-off, as they generally show genomic alterations leading to RAS activation, such as <i>NF1</i> and <i>PTPN11</i> mutations. An integrated clinical, histologic and molecular analysis of the G3/MMR tumors showed distinct characteristics as compared to other glioblastomas, including those with iatrogenic high tumor mutation burden (TMB), warranting a separate subgroup.

The MGCs and p53 immunohistochemistry analysis in G1-G7 subgroups showed that one in 7 tumors with these characteristics is a G3/MMR glioblastoma. The FDA-approved first-line therapy for many advanced solid tumors consists of nivolumab-ipilimumab immune checkpoint inhibitors.

However, O6-MeG repair by O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) contributes to drug resistance. Characterizing genomic profiles of O6-MeG could elucidate how O6-MeG accumulation is influenced by repair, but there are no methods to map genomic locations of O6-MeG. Here, we developed an immunoprecipitation- and polymerase-stalling-based method, termed O6-MeG-seq, to locate O6-MeG across the whole genome at single-nucleotide resolution. We analyzed O6-MeG formation and repair across sequence contexts and functional genomic regions in relation to MGMT expression in a glioblastoma-derived cell line. O6-MeG signatures were highly similar to mutational signatures from patients previously treated with temozolomide. Furthermore, MGMT did not preferentially repair O6-MeG with respect to sequence context, chromatin state or gene expression level, however, may protect oncogenes from mutations. Finally, we found an MGMT-independent strand bias in O6-MeG accumulation in highly expressed genes. These data provide high resolution insight on how O6-MeG formation and repair are impacted by genome structure and nucleotide sequence. Further, O6-MeG-seq is expected to enable future studies of DNA modification signatures as diagnostic markers for addressing drug resistance and preventing secondary cancers.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Disruption of the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway in tumor cells enhances the effectiveness of radiotherapy drugs, while increased mutational burden following tumor cell damage also facilitates the efficacy of immunotherapy. The ATRX gene, located on chromosome X, plays a crucial role in DDR. The aim of this research is to elucidate the correlation between ATRX mutations and GBM. Dataset obtained from TCGA-GBM were conducted an analysis on the genomic features, biological characteristics, immunopathological markers, and clinical prognosis of patients carrying ATRX mutations. Our findings revealed a significantly elevated level of microsatellite instability in individuals with ATRX mutants, along with significant alterations in the receptor-tyrosine kinase (RTK)-ras pathway among patients exhibiting combined ATRX mutations. TCGA-GBM patients with concurrent ATRX mutations exhibited sensitivity to 26 chemotherapeutic and anticancer drugs, which exerted their effects by modulating the DDR of tumor cells through highly correlated mechanisms involving the RTK-ras pathway. Additionally, we observed an enrichment of ATRX mutations in specific pathways associated with DDR among TCGA-GBM patients. Our model also demonstrated prolonged overall survival in patients carrying ATRX mutations, particularly showing strong predictive value for 3- and 5-year survival rates. Furthermore, additional protective factors such as younger age, female gender, combined IDH mutations, and TP53 mutations were identified. The results underscore the protective role and prognostic significance of ATRX mutations in GBM as a potential therapeutic target and biomarker for patient survival.\n\nConsider:\n1.

In a retrospective single-center study the results of sPDT with 5-ALA in 10 patients (6 of 10 were male), aged 30 to 62 years (median: 51.5 years; 95% CI: 38-59 years) with recurrent malignant brain gliomas after standard therapy who underwent surgery during the period of 2020-2023 were analyzed. sPDT was conducted during 15 min using 5-ALA at a dosage of 20 mg/kg, a diode laser with a wavelength of 635 nm and power of 1 W, and the LFT-02-BIOSPEC unit (BIOSPEC, Russia). Three patients got repeated sPDT after 3, 7, and 15 months due to a relapse. The number of target points and the optimal position for intervention paths were determined according to the data of preoperative stereotactic MRI of the brain with contrast intensification using the CRW Precision stereotactic navigation system (Integra, USA) and intraoperative registration of the area with the highest intensity of protoporphyrin IX fluorescence along the path (according to fluorescence biospectroscopy). Glioblastoma (grade IV, WHO) was diagnosed in 7 patients, anaplastic astrocytoma (grade III, WHO) - in 3 persons. Genetic studies were performed for 9 patients, 7 of them had tumors without the <i>IDH1</i> gene mutation. None of the patients had a combined 1p/19q deletion. The median volume of the contrast-enhancing part of the recurrent tumor was 7.95 cm<sup>3</sup> (95% CI: 3.3-13.6 cm<sup>3</sup>). The median time to relapse after sPDT in patients with anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas was 14.5 and 6.5 months, respectively. The median survival time after sPDT in patients with glioblastomas was 15.8 months (95% CI: 0.5-20.1 months), and in patients with anaplastic astrocytomas - 46.3 months (95%, CI not specified). In the early postoperative period, two patients had motor aphasia and hemiparesis, which further regressed. The results of a small group of patients allow to consider sPDT with 5-ALA as a promising technique to treat patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas in functionally relevant brain areas and require further prospective assessment.\n\nConsider:\n1.

However, the mechanisms underlying HOTAIR-mediated TMZ resistance remains poorly understood. HOTAIR expression in glioma-related public datasets and drug response estimation were analyzed using bioinformatics. These findings were verified by overexpressing HOTAIR in TMZ-sensitive U251 cells and/or silencing HOTAIR in resistant U251 cells (U251R). The cytotoxic effects were evaluated using cell viability assay and flow cytometry analysis of cell cycle and apoptosis. In this study, we found that HOTAIR was upregulated in TMZ-resistant GBM cell lines and patients with high HOTAIR expression responded poorly to TMZ therapy. HOTAIR knockdown restored TMZ sensitivity in U251R cells, while HOTAIR overexpression conferred TMZ resistance in U251 cells. Wnt/β-catenin signaling was enriched in patients with high HOTAIR expression; consistently, HOTAIR positively regulated β-catenin expression in U251 cells. Moreover, HOTAIR-mediated TMZ resistance was associated with increased MGMT protein level, which resulted from the HOTAIR/miR-214-3p/β-catenin network. Besides,\xa0GBM with high HOTAIR expression exhibited sensitivity to methotrexate. Methotrexate enhanced TMZ sensitivity in U251R cells, accompanied by reduced expression of HOTAIR and β-catenin.\xa0Thus, we conlcude that HOTAIR is a risk factor for TMZ resistance and methotrexate may represent a potential therapeutic drug for patients with high HOTAIR expression level.\n\nConsider:\n1.

However, the inherent heterogeneity of GBM often results in suboptimal outcomes, particularly due to varying degrees of resistance to TMZ. Over the past several decades, O<sup>6</sup>-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT)-mediated DNA repair pathway has been extensively investigated as a target to overcome TMZ resistance. Nonetheless, the combination of small molecule covalent MGMT inhibitors with TMZ and other chemotherapeutic agents has frequently led to adverse clinical effects. Recently, additional mechanisms contributing to TMZ resistance have been identified, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, overactivation of intracellular signalling pathways, energy metabolism reprogramming or survival autophagy, and changes in tumor microenvironment (TME). These findings suggest that novel therapeutic strategies targeting these mechanisms hold promise for overcoming TMZ resistance in GBM patients. In this review, we summarize the latest advancements in understanding the mechanisms underlying intrinsic and acquired TMZ resistance. Additionally, we compile various small-molecule compounds with potential to mitigate chemoresistance in GBM. These mechanism-based compounds may enhance the sensitivity of GBM to TMZ and related chemotherapeutic agents, thereby improving overall survival rates in clinical practice.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Necroptosis, a pathological hallmark of GBM, is poorly understood in terms of its role in prognosis, tumor microenvironment (TME) alteration, and immunotherapy. We assessed the expression of 55 necroptosis-related genes in GBM and normal brain tissues. We identified necroptosis-stratified clusters using Uni-Cox and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression to establish the 10-gene Glioblastoma Necroptosis Index (GNI). GNI demonstrated significant prognostic efficacy in the TCGA dataset (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u2009160) and internal validation dataset (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u2009345) and in external validation cohorts (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u2009591). The GNI-high subgroup displayed a mesenchymal phenotype, lacking the IDH1 mutation, and MGMT methylation. This subgroup was characterized by significant enrichment in inflammatory and humoral immune pathways with prominent cell adhesion molecules (CD44 and ICAM1), inflammatory cytokines (TGFB1, IL1B, and IL10), and chemokines (CX3CL1, CXCL9, and CCL5). The TME in this subgroup showed elevated infiltration of M0 macrophages, neutrophils, mast cells, and regulatory T cells. GNI-related genes appeared to limit macrophage polarization, as confirmed by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. The top 30% high-risk score subset exhibited increased CD8 T cell infiltration and enhanced cytolytic activity. GNI showed promise in predicting responses to immunotherapy and targeted treatment. Our study highlights the role of necroptosis-related genes in glioblastoma (GBM) and their effects on the tumor microenvironment and patient prognosis. TheGNI demonstrates potential as a prognostic marker and provides insights into immune characteristics and treatment responsiveness.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

Transcription factor AP-2α has been reported to regulate the progression of primary glioblastoma (GBM). However, the function of AP-2α in recurrent gliomas is largely unclear. The expression of AP-2α and O6-methylguanine DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) was detected in recurrent glioma tissues and cell lines by Western blots, the regulation mechanisms between AP-2α/MGMT promoter and RA/AP-2α promoter were studied by luciferase reporter assays, EMSA, and chIP assays. The effects of AP-2α and TMZ/RA treatment on cell viability in vitro and in vivo were investigated by MTT assays, γH<sub>2</sub>AX staining, comet assays and intracranial injection. AP-2α expression negatively correlates with the expression of MGMT in glioma samples. AP-2α could directly bind with the promoter of the MGMT gene, suppresses transcriptional levels of MGMT and downregulate MGMT expression in TMZ-resistant U87MG-R and T98G cells, but TMZ treatment decreases AP-2α expression and increases MGMT expression. The extended TMZ treatment and increased TMZ concentrations reversed these effects. Moreover, AP-2α overexpression combines with TMZ to decrease cell viability, concurrently with improved DNA damage marker γH<sub>2</sub>AX. Furthermore, retinoic acid (RA) activates RAR/RXR heterodimers, which bind to RA-responsive elements (RAREs) of the AP-2α promoter, and activates AP-2α expression in recurrent glioma cells. Finally, in intracranial relapsed glioma mouse model, both RA and TMZ could retard tumor development and prolong the mouse survival. AP-2α activation by gene overexpression or RA treatment reveals the suppressive effects on glioma relapse, providing a novel therapeutic strategy against malignant refractory gliomas.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Tumour reproductive cells (TRCs) have been implicated in the development of chemotherapy resistance. By culturing DBTRG cells in three-dimensional soft fibrin gels to enrich GBM TRCs and performing RNA-seq analysis, the expression of stanniocalcin-1 (STC), a gene encoding a secreted glycoprotein, was found to be upregulated in TRCs. Meanwhile, the viability of TMZ-treated TRC cells was significantly higher than that of TMZ-treated 2D cells. Analysis of clinical data from CGGA (Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas) database showed that high expression of STC1 was closely associated with poor prognosis, glioma grade and resistance to TMZ treatment, suggesting that STC1 may be involved in TMZ drug resistance. The expression of STC1 in tissues and cells was examined, as well as the effect of STC1 on GBM cell proliferation and TMZ-induced DNA damage. The results showed that overexpression of STC1 promoted and knockdown of STC1 inhibited TMZ-induced DNA damage. These results were validated in an intracranial tumour model. These data revealed that STC1 exerts regulatory functions on MGMT expression in GBM, and provides a rationale for targeting STC1 to overcome TMZ resistance.\n\nConsider:\n1.

The authors explored survival rates and factors associated with long-term survival in patients harboring a glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype. In an observational, retrospective, single-center study, the authors examined the medical records of 976 adults newly diagnosed with supratentorial glioblastomas, IDH-wildtype between January 2000 and January 2021. They analyzed clinical-, imaging-, and treatment-related factors associated with 2-year and 5-year survival. The median overall survival was 11.2 months (12.2 months for patients included after 2005 and the introduction of standard combined chemoradiotherapy). The median progression-free survival was 9.4 months (10.0 months for patients included after 2005). Overall, 17.6% of patients reached a 2-year overall survival, while 2.2% of patients reached a 5-year overall survival. Furthermore, 6.6% of patients survived 2 years without progression, while 1.1% of patients survived 5 years without progression. Two factors that were consistently associated with 2-year and 5-year survival were first-line oncological treatment with standard combined chemoradiotherapy and methylated O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter. Other factors that were significantly associated with 2-year or 5-year survival were age at diagnosis ≤ 60 years, headaches or signs of raised intracranial pressure at diagnosis, cortical contact of contrast enhancement, no contrast enhancement crossing the midline on initial imaging, total or subtotal tumor resection, and a second line of oncological treatment at recurrence. Within 21 cases of 5-year survival, 18 were confirmed to be glioblastomas, IDH-wildtype, and 7 of the 5-year survivors (38.9%) had additional genetic alterations: 3 cases had an FGFR mutation or fusion, 3 cases had a PIK3CA mutation, 1 case had a PTPN11 mutation, and 1 case had a PMS2 mutation in the context of constitutional mismatch repair deficiency syndrome. Five-year overall survival in patients with glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype is extremely low. Predictors of a longer survival are mostly treatment factors, emphasizing the importance of a complete oncological treatment plan, when achievable. Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype 5-year survivors could be screened for actionable targets in case of recurrence.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2. Study type and methodology\n3.

The immune environment among subtypes was compared by assessing the expression of immune molecules and the infiltration of immune cells. Molecular subtypes adapted to immunotherapy were identified based on Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) score. Finally, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression was performed on the expression profiles of S2, S3 and S4 in TCGA-GBM and RPPA to determine the respective corresponding best predictive model. Four novel molecular subtypes were classified. Specifically, S1 exhibited a low proliferative profile; S2 exhibited the profile of high proliferation, IDH1 mutation, TP53 mutation and deletion; S3 was characterized by high immune scores, innate immunity and adaptive immune infiltration scores, with the lowest TIDE score and was most likely to benefit from immunotherapy; S4 was characterized by high proliferation, EGFR amplification, and high protein abundance, and was the most suitable subtype for bevacizumab. LASSO analysis constructed the best prediction model composed of 13 genes in S2 with an accuracy of 96.7%, and the prediction model consisting of 17 genes in S3 with an accuracy of 86.7%, and screened 14 genes as components of the best prediction model in S4 with an accuracy of 93%.

Current standard therapies, including surgical resection, radiation, and temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy, often fail to achieve long-term remission due to tumor recurrence and resistance. A pro-oxidant environment is involved in glioma progression, with oxidative stress contributing to the genetic instability that leads to gliomagenesis. Evaluating pro-oxidant therapies in brain tumors is crucial due to their potential to selectively target and eradicate cancer cells by exploiting the elevated oxidative stress levels inherent in these malignant cells, thereby offering a novel and effective strategy for overcoming resistance to conventional therapies. This study investigates the therapeutic potential of doxorubicin (DOX) and photodynamic therapy (PDT) with Me-ALA, focusing on their effects on redox homeostasis. Basal ROS levels and antioxidant gene expression (NFE2L2, CAT, GSR) were quantitatively assessed across GBM cell lines, revealing significant variability probably linked to genetic differences. DOX and PDT treatments, both individually and in combination, were analyzed for their efficacy in inducing oxidative stress and cytotoxicity. An in silico analysis further explored the relationship between gene mutations and oxidative stress in GBM patients, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying treatment responses. Our findings suggest that pro-oxidant therapies, such as DOX and PDT in combination, could selectively target GBM cells, highlighting a promising avenue for improving therapeutic outcomes in GBM.\n\nConsider:\n1.

TAGLN2 is prominently expressed in GBM, particularly in the MES subtype compared to low-grade glioma (LGG) and the PN subtype. Our research reveals TAGLN2's involvement in PMT and TMZ resistance through a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments. TAGLN2 knockdown can restrain proliferation and invasion, trigger DNA damage and apoptosis, and heighten TMZ sensitivity in GBM cells. Conversely, elevating TAGLN2 levels amplifies resistance to TMZ in cellular and intracranial xenograft mouse models. We demonstrate the interaction relationship between TAGLN2 and ERK1/2 through co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) spectrometry analysis. Knockdown of TAGLN2 results in a decrease in the expression of p-ERK1/2, whereas overexpression of TAGLN2 leads to an increase in p-ERK1/2 expression within the nucleus. Subsequently, the regulatory role of TAGLN2 in the expression and control of MGMT has been demonstrated. Finally, the regulation of TAGLN2 by NF-κB has been validated through chromatin immunoprecipitation and ChIP-PCR assays. In conclusion, our results confirm that TAGLN2 exerts its biological functions by interacting with the ERK/MGMT axis and being regulated by NF-κB, thereby facilitating the acquisition of promoting PMT and increased resistance to TMZ therapy in glioblastoma. These results provide valuable insights for the advancement of targeted therapeutic approaches to overcome TMZ resistance in clinical treatments.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

The standard treatment for GBM includes radiation combined with temozolomide, an alkylating agent. Fortunately, IDH1 mutant gliomas are sensitive to this treatment, resulting in a more favorable prognosis.

Therefore, understanding the mechanism(s) by which IDH1 mutant gliomas confer sensitivity to alkylating agents is crucial for developing targeted chemotherapeutic approaches. The base excision repair (BER) pathway is responsible for repairing most base damage induced by alkylating agents. Defects in this pathway can lead to hypersensitivity to these agents due to unresolved DNA damage. The coordinated assembly and disassembly of BER protein complexes are essential for cell survival and for maintaining genomic integrity following alkylating agent exposure. These complexes rely on poly-ADP-ribose formation, an NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent post-translational modification synthesized by PARP1 and PARP2 during the BER process. At the lesion site, poly-ADP-ribose facilitates the recruitment of XRCC1. This scaffold protein helps assemble BER proteins like DNA polymerase beta (Polβ), a bifunctional DNA polymerase containing both DNA synthesis and 5'-deoxyribose-phosphate lyase (5'dRP lyase) activity. Here, we confirm that IDH1 mutant glioma cells have defective NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism, but still produce sufficient nuclear NAD<sup>+</sup> for robust PARP1 activation and BER complex formation in response to DNA damage. However, the overproduction of 2-hydroxyglutarate, an oncometabolite produced by the IDH1 R132H mutant protein, suppresses BER capacity by reducing Polβ protein levels. This defines a novel mechanism by which the IDH1 mutation in gliomas confers cellular sensitivity to alkylating agents and to inhibitors of the poly-ADP-ribose glycohydrolase, PARG.\n\nConsider:\n1.

TCGA analyses revealed distinct expression profiles of IMPDH isoenzymes in various subtypes of GBM and low-grade glioma (LGG). To dissect the mechanism(s) underlying the anti-tumor effect of IMPDH inhibition in adult GBM, we investigated how mycophenolic acid (MPA, an IMPDH inhibitor) treatment affected key oncogenic drivers in glioblastoma cells. Our results showed that MPA decreased the expression of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) in both U87 and U251 cells, and the expression of O<sup>6</sup>-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) in U251 cells. In support, MPA treatment reduced the amount of telomere repeats in U87 and U251 cells. TERT downregulation by MPA was associated with a significant decrease in c-Myc (a TERT transcription activator) in U87 but not U251 cells, and a dose-dependent increase in p53 and CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) (TERT repressors) in both U87 and U251 cells. In U251 cells, MPA displayed strong cytotoxic synergy with BCNU and moderate synergy with irinotecan, oxaliplatin, paclitaxel, or temozolomide (TMZ). In U87 cells, MPA displayed strong cytotoxic synergy with all except TMZ, acting primarily through the apoptotic pathway. Our work expands the mechanistic potential of IMPDH inhibition to TERT/telomere regulation and reveals a synthetic lethality between MPA and anti-GBM drugs.\n\nConsider:\n1.

To address these issues and personalise treatment approaches, we aimed to develop and validate robust multiomics molecular subtypes of IDHwt-GBM. Through this, we sought to uncover the distinct molecular signatures underlying these subtypes, paving the way for improved diagnosis and targeted therapy for this challenging disease. To identify stable molecular subtypes among 184 IDHwt-GBM patients from TCGA, we used the consensus clustering method to consolidate the results from ten advanced multiomics clustering approaches based on mRNA, lncRNA, and mutation data. We developed subtype prediction models using the PAM and machine learning algorithms based on mRNA and MRI data for enhanced clinical utility. These models were validated in five independent datasets, and an online interactive system was created. We conducted a comprehensive assessment of the clinical impact, drug treatment response, and molecular associations of the IDHwt-GBM subtypes. In the TCGA cohort, two molecular subtypes, class 1 and class 2, were identified through multiomics clustering of IDHwt-GBM patients. There was a significant difference in survival between Class 1 and Class 2 patients, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.68 [1.15-2.47]. This difference was validated in other datasets (CGGA: HR\u2009=\u20091.75[1.04, 2.94]; CPTAC: HR\u2009=\u20091.79[1.09-2.91]; GALSS: HR\u2009=\u20091.66[1.09-2.54]; UCSF: HR\u2009=\u20091.33[1.00-1.77]; UPENN HR\u2009=\u20091.29[1.04-1.58]). Additionally, class 2 was more sensitive to treatment with radiotherapy combined with temozolomide, and this sensitivity was validated in the GLASS cohort. Correspondingly, class 2 and class 1 exhibited significant differences in mutation patterns, enriched pathways, programmed cell death (PCD), and the tumour immune microenvironment. Class 2 had more mutation signatures associated with defective DNA mismatch repair (P\u2009=\u20090.0021). Enriched pathways of differentially expressed genes in class 1 and class 2 (P-adjust\u2009<\u20090.05) were mainly related to ferroptosis, the PD-1 checkpoint pathway, the JAK-STAT signalling pathway, and other programmed cell death and immune-related pathways. The different cell death modes and immune microenvironments were validated across multiple datasets. Finally, our developed survival prediction model, which integrates molecular subtypes, age, and sex, demonstrated clinical benefits based on the decision curve in the test set. We deployed the molecular subtyping prediction model and survival prediction model online, allowing interactive use and facilitating user convenience. Molecular subtypes were identified and verified through multiomics clustering in IDHwt-GBM patients. These subtypes are linked to specific mutation patterns, the immune microenvironment, prognoses, and treatment responses.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

This difference was validated in other datasets (CGGA: HR\u2009=\u20091.75[1.04, 2.94]; CPTAC: HR\u2009=\u20091.79[1.09-2.91]; GALSS: HR\u2009=\u20091.66[1.09-2.54]; UCSF: HR\u2009=\u20091.33[1.00-1.77]; UPENN HR\u2009=\u20091.29[1.04-1.58]). Additionally, class 2 was more sensitive to treatment with radiotherapy combined with temozolomide, and this sensitivity was validated in the GLASS cohort. Correspondingly, class 2 and class 1 exhibited significant differences in mutation patterns, enriched pathways, programmed cell death (PCD), and the tumour immune microenvironment. Class 2 had more mutation signatures associated with defective DNA mismatch repair (P\u2009=\u20090.0021). Enriched pathways of differentially expressed genes in class 1 and class 2 (P-adjust\u2009<\u20090.05) were mainly related to ferroptosis, the PD-1 checkpoint pathway, the JAK-STAT signalling pathway, and other programmed cell death and immune-related pathways. The different cell death modes and immune microenvironments were validated across multiple datasets. Finally, our developed survival prediction model, which integrates molecular subtypes, age, and sex, demonstrated clinical benefits based on the decision curve in the test set. We deployed the molecular subtyping prediction model and survival prediction model online, allowing interactive use and facilitating user convenience. Molecular subtypes were identified and verified through multiomics clustering in IDHwt-GBM patients. These subtypes are linked to specific mutation patterns, the immune microenvironment, prognoses, and treatment responses.\n\nProvide a focused summary that:\n1.

The current standard-of-care for GBM patients involves surgical resection followed by radiotherapy, combined with concurrent and adjuvant chemotherapy using Temozolomide (TMZ). The effectiveness of TMZ primarily relies on the activity of O<sup>6</sup>-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), which removes alkyl adducts from the O<sup>6</sup> position of guanine at the DNA level, thereby counteracting the toxic effects of TMZ. In this study, we employed fusions of catalytically-inactive Cas9 (dCas9) to DNA methyltransferases (dCas9-DNMT3A) to selectively downregulation MGMT transcription by inducing methylation at MGMT promoter and K-M enhancer. Our findings demonstrate a significant reduction in MGMT expression, leading to intensified TMZ sensitivity in the HEK293T cell line. This study serves as a proof of concept for the utilization of CRISPR-based gene suppression to overcome TMZ resistance and enhance the lethal effect of TMZ in glioblastoma tumor cells.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Incorporation of doxorubicin into PLGA nanoparticles allows increasing the antitumor effect of the cytostatics against experimental rat glioblastoma 101.8. Animal survival, tumor volume, and oncogene expression in tumor cells were compared after early (days 2, 5, and 8 after tumor implantation) and late (days 8, 11, and 14) start of the therapy. At late start, a significant increase in the expression of oncogenes Gdnf, Pdgfra, and Melk and genes determining the development of multidrug resistance Abcb1b and Mgmt was revealed. At early start of therapy, only the expression of oncogenes Gdnf, Pdgfra, and Melk was enhanced. Early start of treatment prolonged the survival time and increased tumor growth inhibition by 141.4 and 95.7%, respectively, in comparison with the untreated group; these differences were not observed in the group with late start of therapy. The results indicate that the time of initiation of therapy is a critical parameter affecting the antitumor efficacy of DOX-PLGA.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

The aptamer demonstrated anti-proliferative effects by altering gene expression related to neurogenesis, cell differentiation, and key oncogenic signaling pathways mediated by EGFR. These findings suggest Gol1 could be a promising candidate for targeted GB therapy.\n\n#### **Methodology Overview:**  \nResearchers designed the aptamer Gol1 based on the structure of the previously studied U2 aptamer, using molecular dynamics simulations to optimize stability. The anti-proliferative effects of Gol1 were tested on patient-derived GB continuous cell cultures (G01 and BU881) with varying EGFR and EGFRvIII expression. Transcriptome analysis was performed on G01 cells post-treatment to assess gene expression changes.\n\n#### **Population Characteristics:**  \nThe study used two patient-derived GB cell cultures:  \n- **G01:** High EGFR/EGFRvIII expression  \n- **BU881:** Lower EGFR/EGFRvIII expression  \n\n#### **Key Statistical Results:**  \n- Gol1 treatment led to **significant transcriptional changes**, upregulating genes involved in neurogenesis and differentiation while downregulating genes regulating nuclear processes.  \n- Key oncogenic pathways mediated by EGFR were disrupted, though specific fold changes or p-values were not provided in the abstract.  \n\n#### **Clinical Implications:**  \nGol1 demonstrates potential as a novel **targeted therapy** for GB patients with EGFR mutations, particularly EGFRvIII, which is associated with aggressive tumor behavior and poor prognosis. This approach could complement existing treatments like immunotherapy and tumor-treating fields (TTF) by specifically inhibiting tumor-promoting pathways. Further clinical validation is needed to confirm efficacy and safety in patient populations.\n\nArticle PMID:39919036\n### Summary of Findings in Relation to GBM Mutations and Treatment Effectiveness  \n\n#### **Main Findings and Conclusions:**  \n- **TP53 mutations** significantly influence the transcriptional response to radiation (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ), with wild-type (wt) TP53 GBM cells showing treatment-modulated responses.  \n- **MGMT protein levels**, rather than just MGMT promoter methylation status, correlate with TMZ resistance, with NF-κB activation playing a key role.  \n- **Differentiation state** impacts therapy response: differentiated cancer stem cells (CSCs) upregulate BMP-Smad signaling and extracellular matrix components, increasing TMZ resistance but not RT resistance.  \n- **DNA-damage-induced interferon (IFN) response** is activated in both mutant and wt TP53 GBM models, suggesting a shared resistance mechanism.  \n- **NF-κB inhibition** presents a potential therapeutic target to overcome TMZ resistance.  \n\n#### **Methodology Overview:**  \n- **Multi-omics approach**: Targeted proteomics, transcriptomics, genomics, and DNA methylation profiling were used to analyze GBM patient-derived CSCs.  \n- **Experimental conditions**: Cells were subjected to astrocytic differentiation and treated with RT and TMZ.  \n\n#### **Population Characteristics:**  \n- **Patient-derived GBM CSC models** representing genomic and molecular diversity.  \n- **TP53-mutant and wt models** were included to assess differential responses.  \n\n#### **Key Statistical Results:**  \n- **NF-κB activation positively correlated** with MGMT protein levels (p-value not provided).  \n- **Differentiated CSCs showed increased TMZ resistance** across all models (quantitative resistance levels not specified).  \n- **IFN response was significantly activated** in both mutant and wt TP53 cells post-treatment.  \n\n#### **Clinical Implications:**  \n- **TP53 status should be considered** for personalized treatment strategies, as it modulates therapy response.  \n- **MGMT protein levels, beyond promoter methylation, may predict TMZ resistance**, highlighting the potential role of NF-κB inhibitors in overcoming resistance.  \n- **Targeting the IFN and NF-κB pathways** could enhance the effectiveness of current GBM therapies.  \n- **Implications for immunotherapy**: IFN response activation suggests potential interactions with immune-based treatments.  \n\nThis study underscores the importance of integrating genomic and molecular profiling into GBM treatment planning,\n\nArticle PMID:39864140\n### Summary  \n\nThis study investigates the impact of **IDH1 mutations** on immune checkpoint expression and potential therapeutic targets in **glioblastoma (GBM)** using two independent **next-generation sequencing (NGS) datasets** (n = 577 and n = 153) from TCGA.  \n\n#### **Main Findings & Conclusions**  \n- **IDH1 mutations (IDH1<sup>Mu</sup>)** were found in **5.4%** of GBM cases and were associated with **improved overall survival (OS)** (p = **2.196e-3**).  \n- **PDCD1 (PD-1) and CD274 (PD-L1) expression** was significantly elevated in both **IDH1<sup>Wt</sup> and IDH1<sup>Mu</sup> GBMs** (p < **0.0001**), with **higher expression linked to worse OS** (PDCD1: p = **0.009**; CD274: p = **0.02**).  \n- **Differential gene expression:**  \n  - **IDH1<sup>Wt</sup> GBMs** showed **PTEN upregulation** and **MUC16 downregulation**.  \n  - **IDH1<sup>Mu</sup> GBMs** exhibited **PIK3R1 upregulation**, suggesting activation of the **PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway**.  \n- **Therapeutic Implications:**  \n  - **Both IDH1<sup>Wt</sup> and IDH1<sup>Mu</sup> GBMs** may benefit from **immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)** due to high **PDCD1/CD274 expression**.  \n  - **IDH1<sup>Mu</sup> GBMs** may require **a combination of ICIs and PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors** due to **PIK3R1 overexpression**.  \n  - **PIK3R1 and ITGB2** were identified as **potential druggable targets**.  \n\n#### **Methodology Overview**  \n- **Mutation analysis** via **cBioPortal**  \n- **RNA sequencing** for gene expression  \n- **miRNA differential expression** using **miRDB and miRabel**  \n- **Survival analysis** via **Kaplan-Meier curves**\n\nArticle PMID:39835141\n### Focused Summary  \n\n#### **Main Findings & Conclusions:**  \nThis study identifies a new glioblastoma (GBM) molecular subgroup, **G3/MMR**, characterized by mismatch repair (MMR) gene mutations (e.g., *MSH2*, *MSH6*) and high tumor mutation burden (TMB). Patients in this subgroup had **significantly worse survival (median 3.25 months post-surgery)** compared to other GBM subgroups. However, one patient treated with **nivolumab-ipilimumab (immune checkpoint inhibitors)** showed prolonged survival, suggesting potential responsiveness to immunotherapy.\n\n#### **Methodology Overview:**  \nResearchers conducted an integrated clinical, histologic, and molecular analysis of **218 GBM patients** classified into **G1-G7 molecular subgroups** based on **MAPK pathway activation**. They identified **five patients** with germline MMR mutations (Lynch syndrome) and assigned them to the new **G3/MMR subgroup**, a subset of **G3/NF1 tumors** with **RAS pathway alterations** (*NF1, PTPN11* mutations).  \n\n#### **Population Characteristics:**  \n- **218 patients** in a prospective cohort  \n- **5 patients (G3/MMR subgroup)** with germline MMR mutations  \n- High-risk features: **midline/multifocal tumors, multinucleated giant cells (MGCs), p53 positivity**  \n\n#### **Key Statistical Results:**  \n- **Median survival for G3/MMR:** **3.25 months post-surgery** (significantly worse than G1/EGFR, G3/NF1, and age-adjusted cohort)  \n- **One G3/MMR patient** treated with nivolumab-ipilimumab had **notably longer survival**, supporting immunotherapy efficacy in this subgroup  \n\n#### **Clinical Implications:**  \n- **G3/MMR tumors represent a high-risk GBM subgroup** with poor prognosis but potential sensitivity to **immune checkpoint inhibitors**.  \n- **Molecular profiling (MMR status, TMB, TP53, PTEN, PIK3CA mutations)** is crucial for identifying patients who may benefit from **immunotherapy**.  \n- Findings suggest that **standard GBM treatments may be inadequate for G3/MMR patients**, warranting further investigation into targeted immunotherapy strategies.  \n\nThis study underscores the importance of **personalized treatment approaches** in GB\n\nArticle PMID:39684714\nThis study analyzed the molecular profiles of 131 diffuse glioma patients to assess the impact of genetic mutations on prognosis and treatment response. Using Illumina sequencing of 812 cancer-associated genes, researchers identified key mutations in low-grade glioma (LGG) and high-grade glioma (HGG) patients. In LGG (n = 18), frequent mutations included **IDH1/2 (78%)**, **TP53 (44%)**, and **ATRX (33%)**, while HGG (n = 113) showed higher rates of **TERTp (71%)**, **PTEN (60%)**, **EGFR (40%)**, and **CDKN2A/B (33%)**.  \n\n**Key findings:**  \n- **IDH1/2 mutations were linked to better prognosis**, while **TERTp mutations and PTEN deletions were associated with worse outcomes**.  \n- In IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, prior cancer history correlated with worse survival, whereas **bevacizumab therapy and re-operation improved overall survival (OS)**.  \n- **Nine patients received molecular targeted therapy**, though specific treatment responses were not detailed.  \n\n**Clinical implications:**  \nThese results emphasize the prognostic significance of **IDH1/2, TERTp, and PTEN mutations** in glioblastoma and suggest potential benefits of **bevacizumab and surgical re-intervention**. The study supports further exploration of targeted therapies based on molecular profiling to improve treatment efficacy.\n\nArticle PMID:39085480\nThis study aimed to classify glioblastoma (GBM) into novel molecular subtypes to predict treatment response, particularly to immunotherapy and targeted therapies. Using TCGA data, researchers applied BayesNM for subtype identification, gene set enrichment analysis for biological characterization, and Genomic Identification of Significant Targets in Cancer analysis for genomic profiling. Immune environment differences were assessed via Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) scores, and LASSO logistic regression was used to develop predictive models.\n\nFour molecular subtypes were identified:  \n- **S1**: Low proliferation.  \n- **S2**: High proliferation, IDH1 and TP53 mutations, associated with a 13-gene predictive model (96.7% accuracy).  \n- **S3**: High immune infiltration, low TIDE score, best suited for immunotherapy, with a 17-gene predictive model (86.7% accuracy).  \n- **S4**: High proliferation, EGFR amplification, high protein abundance, best suited for bevacizumab, with a 14-gene predictive model (93% accuracy).  \n\nThese findings suggest that molecular subtyping can guide personalized GBM treatment. Specifically, S3 patients may benefit most from immunotherapy, while S4 patients could respond well to bevacizumab. This classification could enhance treatment selection, improving patient outcomes.\n\nArticle PMID:38897003\n### Focused Summary  \n\n#### **Main Findings and Conclusions:**  \nIDH1-mutant gliomas exhibit increased sensitivity to alkylating agents, such as temozolomide, due to impaired base excision repair (BER). This sensitivity is driven by the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), which reduces DNA polymerase beta (Polβ) protein levels, a critical component of BER. Despite defective NAD⁺ metabolism, IDH1-mutant cells maintain sufficient nuclear NAD⁺ for PARP1 activation, but their BER capacity remains suppressed. This suggests that IDH1 mutations may enhance responsiveness to both alkylating agents and poly-ADP-ribose glycohydrolase (PARG) inhibitors.  \n\n#### **Methodology Overview:**  \nThe study used IDH1-mutant glioma cell models to assess NAD⁺ metabolism, PARP1 activation, and BER complex formation. Researchers measured Polβ protein levels and analyzed DNA repair capacity following alkylating agent exposure.  \n\n#### **Population Characteristics:**  \nThe study focused on IDH1-mutant glioma cells, which are primarily found in secondary GBM and low-grade gliomas but are rare in primary GBM.  \n\n#### **Key Statistical Results:**  \n- Up to **75%** of IDH1-mutant gliomas progress to WHO grade IV and develop resistance to alkylating agents.  \n- Despite defective NAD⁺ metabolism, nuclear NAD⁺ levels were sufficient for PARP1 activation.  \n- 2-HG overproduction led to reduced Polβ protein levels, impairing BER function.  \n\n#### **Clinical Implications:**  \n- IDH1-mutant GBMs may respond well to temozolomide initially but could develop resistance over time.  \n- Targeting BER deficiencies with PARG inhibitors could enhance treatment efficacy.  \n- Understanding IDH1-related repair defects may inform personalized therapy strategies, particularly for secondary GBM.  \n\nThis study highlights the potential for exploiting IDH1-associated vulnerabilities to improve GBM treatment outcomes.\n\nArticle PMID:38890658\nThis study investigated the molecular heterogeneity of IDH1-wildtype glioblastoma (IDHwt-GBM) to improve treatment personalization. Using consensus clustering on multiomics data (mRNA, lncRNA, mutations) from 184 TCGA patients, researchers identified two molecular subtypes, Class 1 and Class 2. These subtypes were validated in five independent datasets (CGGA, CPTAC, GALSS, UCSF, UPENN) and linked to distinct mutation patterns, immune microenvironments, and treatment responses.  \n\nKey findings:  \n- **Survival differences**: Class 2 had better survival than Class 1 (TCGA HR = 1.68 [1.15-2.47]; validated across datasets, e.g., CGGA HR = 1.75 [1.04-2.94]).  \n- **Treatment response**: Class 2 showed greater sensitivity to radiotherapy plus temozolomide, validated in the GLASS cohort.  \n- **Mutation and pathway differences**: Class 2 had more defective DNA mismatch repair signatures (P = 0.0021). Pathway enrichment showed differences in ferroptosis, PD-1 checkpoint, and JAK-STAT signaling.  \n\nClinical implications: These subtypes provide a molecular basis for stratifying IDHwt-GBM patients, influencing prognosis prediction and treatment selection, particularly for immunotherapy and DNA repair-targeting strategies.

While this approach is widely used as standard therapy, it carries an increased risk of immune-related and radiation-induced pneumonitis. Currently, there is no data on pneumonitis in patients receiving CCRT with an overall dose of 70\u202fGy (Gy) compared with the standard protocol of 60\u202fGy\u202f±\u200910% in this setting. This study analyzed retrospective data from 39\xa0patients with unresectable NSCLC treated with CCRT. Patients received either 70\u202fGy (n\u202f=\u200929) or lower than 70\u202fGy total dose (n\u202f=\u200910) in 2\u202fGy fractions. Cases of pneumonitis were further classified as RI‑P (Radio-induced Pneumonitis) and ICI‑P (ICI Pneumonitis) based on clinical and radiological findings. Of the 39\xa0patients, 15\xa0(38.5%) developed pneumonitis, with 10\xa0out of 29\xa0(34.5%) in the 70\u202fGy\xa0group\xa0and five out 10\xa0(50%) in the <\u202f70\u202fGy\xa0group. There was no significant difference in pneumonitis and in occurrence of ICI‑P vs. RI‑P (26.7% vs. 73.3%) within both groups. The 70\u202fGy\xa0group\xa0showed a\xa0significant benefit in mortality (p\u202f=\u2009<\u202f0.001). Overall survival (OS) differed significantly between groups (p\u202f=0.028). 70\u202fGy radiation dose for CCRT followed by durvalumab is a\xa0safe regimen and may provide clinical benefits in NSCLC patients compared to lower doses. Pneumonitis incidence aligns with previous literature. The higher dose is associated with improved overall survival, and reduced disease progression, potentially due to a\xa0longer consolidation time.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

LUAD data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) validated ICD-related molecular subtypes via consensus clustering. Clinical features, ICD genes, driver genes, mutations, tumor microenvironment, immune checkpoints, and drug sensitivity were compared. RT-qPCR, Western blot, immunofluorescence, ELISA, flow cytometry, and tube formation assays validated findings. Differential expression of 33 ICD genes was observed between tumor and normal tissues. These genes were clustered into two groups via consensus clustering and validated with GEO data. Prognostic analysis indicated superior outcomes in cluster 2 across TCGA and GEO cohorts. Significant disparities in clinicopathological characteristics like stage, gender, and age were noted between subtypes. Cluster 2 exhibited heightened expression of ICD-related genes, driver genes, immune checkpoints, and immune cells. Cluster 2 also showed increased sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs. IFNG overexpression in A549 and H1299 cells induced CRT exposure, HMGB1 release, and ATP secretion, thereby promoting dendritic cell maturation and enhancing CD8+ T cell function. Additionally, IFNG boosted tumor angiogenesis via HMGB1 pathways, which could be mitigated by HMGB1 inhibition. Identification of novel ICD-related molecular subtypes holds promise for guiding personalized therapies, assessing prognosis, and predicting immunotherapy efficacy in LUAD. IFNG emerges as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target, influencing both the tumor microenvironment and angiogenesis. These findings offer new insights into therapeutic strategies targeting IFNG-mediated pathways in LUAD.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2. Study type and methodology\n3.

However, the immunosuppressive environment within tumors can diminish the efficacy of these vaccines. Cold exposure (CE) therapy, a noninvasive and straightforward antitumor method, not only suppresses tumor metabolism but also ameliorates the immunosuppressive tumor milieu. In this study, we developed personalized TV using copper single-atom nanozyme (Cu SAZ) and enhanced their long-term antitumor efficacy by introducing CE. We initially synthesized the Cu SAZ via high-temperature carbonization, which demonstrated robust POD activity and photothermal characteristics. Upon exposure to 808 nm laser irradiation, the nanozyme generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and heat, inducing immunogenic cell death in 4T1 breast cancer cells or CT26 colon cancer cells and facilitating TV production. In our <i>in vivo</i> tumor prevention and treatment model, we noted that CE significantly boosted the efficacy of the TV. The primary mechanism involves CE's ability to lower the ratio of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), decrease glucose metabolism in tumor cells, and increase the proportions of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and memory T cells. Collectively, our findings offer promising avenues for designing innovative TV systems.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2. Study type and methodology\n3.

C18 and C20 GD2 lipoforms can be simultaneously measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). We evaluated the diagnostic and prognostic performance of circulating GD2 levels in children with NB. Thirty microliters of peripheral blood (PB) plasma samples from 83 children with NB at diagnosis and 83 age-matched healthy controls were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. From stage M patients, 29 additional PB plasma samples were collected after induction therapy, 7 before and after immunotherapy, and 6 at relapse. For 22 stage M patients, bone marrow (BM) plasma samples were also collected at diagnosis. C18 and C20 GD2 concentrations were significantly higher in children with NB than in controls. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed a cut-point of 44.1 and 0.47 nM for C18 and C20, respectively, able to discriminate with high specificity and sensitivity in patients with NB from controls. Circulating C18 and C20 levels in PB strongly correlated with those in BM. At diagnosis, C18 and C20 GD2 concentrations were significantly higher in stage M, deceased patients, and in those bearing tumors with MYCN amplification. ROC analysis identified prognostic cut points for the whole population, whereas only C20 concentrations above the cut points were significantly associated with a worse event-free survival of patients with stage M disease or with MYCN-amplified tumors. C18 and C20 plasma concentrations strongly decreased during treatment but increased at relapse. Measurement of circulating GD2 seems to have prognostic power in the subsets of patients with stage M disease and with MYCN-amplified tumors, and be able to early detect relapse, thus its ability to monitor disease should be prospectively evaluated in future studies.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Preclinical data suggest that the combination of SEL with checkpoint blockade may result in improved response to immunotherapy. NCT02419495 was a multiarm phase IB study of SEL in combination with other standard regimens in patients with advanced malignancies. Arm M utilized twice weekly oral SEL and intravenous nivolumab (NIVO). Arm N utilized weekly oral SEL with NIVO plus ipilimumab (IPI). The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the safety of SEL\u2009+\u2009NIVO and SEL\u2009+\u2009NIVO+IPI. Secondary objectives included determining the objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS). Twenty-nine patients were enrolled in the study, of which 26 (90%) had clear cell RCC (ccRCC). Most patients (72%, n\u2009=\u200921) had prior systemic therapies. All patients (100%) developed at least one treatment-emergent adverse event, and 93% had a treatment-related adverse event (TRAE). Grade ≥\u20093 TRAE occurred in 31% of patients, including 10% with hyponatremia, 7% with neutropenia, and 7% with thromboembolic events. At a median follow-up of 12.4\u2009months, the ORR in 27 patients evaluable for response was 19% (n\u2009=\u20095). An additional 17 patients (63%) had stable disease (SD) as the best response. The median PFS for the overall cohort was 14.5\u2009months (95% CI 5.2-17.4\u2009months; SEL\u2009+\u2009NIVO+IPI: 12.2\u2009months, SEL\u2009+\u2009NIVO: 14.5\u2009months). The median overall survival was 27.8\u2009months (95% CI 15.3-32.5; SEL\u2009+\u2009NIVO+IPI: unreached, SEL\u2009+\u2009NIVO: 21.3\u2009months). SEL in combination with NIVO or NIVO+IPI had a potentially favorable safety profile and showed modest clinical activity in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma. This clinical trial was registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02419495).\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2. Study type and methodology\n3. Population characteristics\n4.

Additionally, PDAC is characterized by an immunosuppressive microenvironment (TME), making it a difficult tumor to treat. While γδ T cells have shown potential for anti-tumor activity, conflicting studies exist regarding their effectiveness in pancreatic cancer. This study aims to explore the hypothesis that the PDAC TME hinders the anti-tumor capabilities of γδ T cells through blockade of cytotoxic functions. For this reason, we chose to enroll PDAC treatment-naive patients to avoid the possibility of therapy modifying the TME. By flow cytometry, our research findings indicate that the presence of γδ T cells among CD45+ cells in tumor tissue is lower compared to CD66+ cells, but higher than in blood. Circulating Vδ1 T cells exhibit a terminal effector memory phenotype (TEMRA) more than Vδ2 T cells. Interestingly, Vδ1 and Vδ2 T cells appear to be more prevalent at different stages of tumor development. In our <i>in vitro</i> culture using conditioned medium derived from Patient-derived organoids ;(PDOs), we observed a shift in expression markers in γδ T cells of healthy individuals toward an activation and exhaustion phenotype, as confirmed by scRNA-seq analysis extracted from a public database. A deeper understanding of γδ T cells in PDAC could be valuable for developing novel therapies aimed at mitigating the impact of the pancreatic tumor microenvironment on this cell population.\n\nConsider:\n1.

A key obstacle in understanding the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer lies in its high inter-patient and spatial heterogeneity, making standard treatments ineffective. Commonly, the study on colorectal cancer relies on bulk RNA sequencing, offering an average gene expression profile for a heterogenous cell population. However, this approach obscures the heterogeneous characteristics of the cancer cells and hinders a comprehensive understanding of the complex interplay among different cell populations. Recently, the advent of single-cell RNA sequencing has been revolutionary, enabling researchers to analyze individual immune cells and overcome the limitations of bulk RNA sequencing. Through single-cell RNA sequencing, researchers have gained insights into the dynamic nature of the immune response to cancer and potential targets for immunotherapy. In this review, we discuss the technical aspects of single-cell RNA sequencing, the application of single-cell RNA sequencing in cancer immunology, and the potential of single-cell RNA in clinical settings. We believe that harnessing singlecell RNA sequencing in cancer research holds immense potential to drive the development of personalized immunotherapies, aiming to improve patient outcomes in colorectal cancer.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Although the precise cause of PD is still unknown, various factors such as pesticide exposure, genetics, and lifestyle choices like smoking and caffeine consumption are thought to play a role in its development. The presence of Lewy bodies characterizes the disease, the aggregation of alpha-synuclein, the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, and disruptions in basal ganglia circuitry, resulting in both motor and nonmotor symptoms. This review is structured into several key sections, beginning with an exploration of the pathophysiological mechanisms behind PD, including how genetic mutations can lead to deficits in the Ubiquitin Proteasome System and mitochondrial function, which are linked to familial cases of the disease. Following this, the article explores diagnostic methods, such as the UK Brain Bank Criteria, advanced imaging techniques, olfactory testing, and innovative technologies like machine learning, all of which support early detection and accurate diagnosis of PD. Treatment strategies are also comprehensively reviewed, focusing on traditional pharmacological options like levodopa and dopamine agonists, as well as surgical interventions such as deep brain stimulation. Additionally, the review discusses promising new therapies, including immunotherapy aimed at neuroinflammation and gene therapy for disease modification. The impact of lifestyle changes such as exercise and diet on reducing PD risk and enhancing symptom management are also considered. In conclusion, this review highlights the complex nature of Parkinson's disease and underscores the need for a holistic approach that combines pharmacotherapy, advanced treatments, and lifestyle adjustments. By addressing both symptom management and disease modification, these strategies provide hope for improving quality of life.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

This study explored the mutation status of disulfidptosis-related genes (DRGs) in cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma (CESC). After analyzing the mutation profiles of DRGs in CESC, this study established a prognostic model for CESC and also explored the differences in immune infiltration (accumulation of immune system cells in tissues or organs), related enriched pathways, and drug sensitivity between high-risk and low-risk CESC groups. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) were accessed to source related data. The mutation profiles of DRGs in CESC were analyzed using Mutect2 software, and disulfidptosis scores were calculated by ssGSEA. WGCNA was performed to identify modular genes, which were further filtered and used to formulate a risk model by applying the survival and glmnet packages. Low- and high-risk groups of CESC patients were classified using the survminer package. GSEA was performed to conduct pathway analysis, and immune infiltration was assessed using the MCPcounter package, ESTIMATE, and TIMER algorithms. Finally, immunotherapy response and drug sensitivity were analyzed using the TIDE method and the pRRophetic package, respectively. Except for NDUFA11, ARL6IP5, EPM2AIP1, GBE1, RBM38, ULK4, and ZBTB47 were found to be the DRGs significantly mutated in CESC. The six genes were integrated to develop a RiskScore model with a relatively high Area Under the Curve (AUC) value. Significant differences between the two risk groups were determined, indicating that the model was highly reliable. Notably, the low-risk group was enriched in energy metabolism-correlated pathways, while the high-risk group was primarily enriched in immune-correlated pathways. The high-risk group showed higher immune cell activity, higher TIDE score, and more B cells than the low-risk group. Drug sensitivity study revealed that the high-risk group was more sensitive to chemotherapy drugs. This study provides novel insights into CESC prognosis, immunotherapy, and drug development, contributing to the clinical treatment for CESC.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

Due to its high rate of incidence, innovative and effective treatments are crucial. Among these, immunothera-peutic approaches have emerged as transformative, offering new hope by harnessing the body's immune system to target and eliminate cancerous cells. Immunotherapy has changed the treatment landscape for skin cancer, providing options such as checkpoint inhibitors and adoptive cell transfer therapies that specifically enhance immune activity against tumors. De-spite these advancements, the broader adoption of immunotherapeutic modalities is challeng-ing due to concerns about their toxicity and variable efficacy. The side effects, such as im-mune-related adverse events, can be severe and sometimes limit their use. In response to these challenges, nanotechnology in cancer treatment has gained significant attention. Nanotechnol-ogy-based approaches show promise in improving the delivery and effectiveness of cancer therapies, particularly for skin cancer immunotherapy. Nanoparticles can deliver therapeutic agents directly to tumors, minimizing systemic toxicity and enhancing treatment precision. These strategies also boost the immune system's ability to target cancer cells while overcom-ing the limitations of current immunotherapies. This review explores various anticancer thera-peutic approaches for managing skin cancer, focusing on immunotherapy and its challenges. It highlights how integrating nanotechnology with cancer immunotherapy offers a promising av-enue for enhancing treatment efficacy and safety. The review also provides an overview of re-cent advancements in skin cancer treatment, showcasing how these innovative strategies are paving the way for more effective and less toxic therapeutic options in combating one of the deadliest cancers.\n\nConsider:\n1.

To determine the effect of an educational intervention on childhood immunization uptake for infants aged ≤ 16 weeks in 5 rural districts of Sindh Province, Pakistan. This quasi-experimental study was conducted from September 2023 to January 2024 among parents of 1200 children aged 3-5 weeks enrolled in intervention and control villages. Education campaigns that included face-to-face sessions and distribution of print and video information materials were conducted with families of children in the intervention group. Multivariable Cox regression was used to assess the effect of the intervention on immunization uptake. After the initial immunization at birth, 19.8% of infants in the intervention villages and 24.8% in the control villages had not completed their Expanded Programme on Immunization vaccinations at age 16 weeks. Children in the intervention villages were significantly more likely to have been completely vaccinated at 14 weeks. Age, gender, household monthly income, place of birth, maternal education, and distance from immunization facility were not significantly associated with uptake. Educational interventions, including use of social media, can help increase childhood immunization uptake in rural areas of developing countries like Pakistan.\n\nConsider:\n1.

The diversification of HCC treatments has recently increased, with the choice of strategy based on HCC characteristics, liver function and comorbidities. The combination of new therapies has transformed the prognosis, with up to 70% survival at 5\u200ayears. The aim of this review was to analyse the most recent data on preoperative evaluation, peri-operative anaesthetic management of liver resection, liver transplantation and other types of procedures, and to highlight the multidisciplinary aspect of such management. The importance of preanaesthetic evaluation will depend largely on the procedure proposed, associated co-morbidities and the stage of liver disease. This assessment should verify stabilisation of all comorbidities, and evaluate the degree of portal hypertension, cirrhosis severity and sarcopenia. Liver resection and liver transplantation for HCC present specific surgical challenges, and minimally invasive techniques improve recovery. Nonsurgical procedures considered as therapeutic (ablation) or standby (regional embolisation) are diverse, and all expose patients to specific intra-anaesthetic complications, sometimes requiring intensive care management. Peri-operative anaesthetic strategies deployed in the management of liver resection or nonsurgical procedures involve specific management of fluids, coagulation, narcosis and analgesia, which can impact on patients' overall, and cancer prognosis. Lastly, new down-staging strategies combining several types of procedure and possibly immunotherapy, also call for collegial reflection on posthepatic transplant immunosuppression, which must remain tailored to each individual patient.\n\nConsider:\n1.

However, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are not devoid of side effects, collectively regarded as immune-related adverse events (irAE); they are not easily uncovered in preclinical immunotoxicological investigations and are often due to the very low expression of their targets in immunologically-unchallenged non-clinical species. We have characterized expression of a broad range of immune checkpoint receptors in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) subpopulations from cynomolgus monkeys and healthy human volunteers, under resting and T-cell stimulatory conditions by multicolor flow cytometry to inform appropriate species selection for modeling potential irAE in immunotherapeutic preclinical research. Focusing on the response of the main lymphocyte populations to interleukin (IL)-2 alone, or in combination with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies, checkpoints with shared similarities and key differences between the two species were identified. The results of this first study provide a database for the expression and response to stimulation for immune checkpoint receptors and can help guide future model selection in the design of preclinical studies involving immunotherapeutics directed against these targets.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Blockade of CTLA-4, PD-1 or PD-L1 by checkpoint inhibitors (CIs), unleashing immune responses, has become a mainstay in the treatment of diverse types of cancer. The induction of autoinflammatory, yet unspecific tissue damage in diverse organs is called an immune related adverse event (irAE), a class side-effect of CIs and may require the discontinuation of immunotherapy. Among frequent skin rashes, CIs targeting the PD-L1/PD-1 axis can elicit the IgG autoantibody- and granulocyte-driven bullous pemphigoid (BP) in about 0.3% to 0.6% of treated patients. Pathogenesis of BP requires a complex cellular inflammatory response after anti-BP180 autoantibody binding to the dermal epidermal junction. The prevalence of autoantibodies against BP180 in healthy blood donors of approximately 0.52% equals the prevalence of irBP among treated cancer patients, underlining the potential relevance of the PD-1 mediated regulation of tissue inflammation for spontaneous BP. If skin rashes appear during CI therapy, biopsies should be taken and examined by histopathological and direct immunofluorescence microscopy.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

Studies have shown that the survival rate for advanced-stage patients is less than 5%, with a median overall survival (OS) of less than 6.5 months. Herein, we report a case of locally advanced PSC in a 56-year-old male patient who received platinum-based double-drug therapy combined with anti-angiogenic drugs, followed by immunotherapy as the first-line systemic treatment. After undergoing eight cycles of neoadjuvant therapy, the opportunity for surgery arose. Postoperative pathology confirmed that the neoadjuvant chemotherapy in this regimen achieved pathological complete remission (pCR). At present, the patient maintains a good quality of life, continues with immunotherapy for consolidation and prevention of recurrence, and has reached a survival period of 10 months. For patients with locally advanced PSC who do not have significant genetic mutations, the use of immunotherapy as a first-line neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy may hold promise for achieving a pCR. Further research into this treatment protocol is warranted.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2. Study type and methodology\n3. Population characteristics\n4.

However, in the specific cancer type of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), standardized protocols for neoadjuvant immunotherapy remain to be defined. This systematic review and meta-analysis focus on evaluating the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in the treatment of HCC, aiming to provide a robust basis for clinical decision-making. This study systematically searched databases such as PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and conference proceedings to identify clinical trials focusing on patients with HCC undergoing neoadjuvant immunotherapy. The Review Manager 5.4 software was applied to estimate the odds ratio (OR) of effect sizes and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) demonstrate significant efficacy in improving pathological outcomes and safety profiles in patients with resectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Specifically, ICIs significantly increase the pathological complete response (pCR) rate (OR\u202f=\u202f0.23, 95% CI [0.14, 0.37], <i>p</i>\u202f<\u202f0.00001) and major pathological response (MPR) rate (OR\u202f=\u202f0.47, 95% CI [0.32, 0.70], <i>p</i>\u202f=\u202f0.0002). They also markedly enhance the objective response rate (ORR) (OR\u202f=\u202f0.42, 95% CI [0.28, 0.63], <i>p</i>\u202f<\u202f0.0001). Furthermore, ICIs potentially improve the surgical resection rate (OR\u202f=\u202f3.91, 95% CI [2.05, 7.45], <i>p</i>\u202f<\u202f0.0001) and reduce the incidence of grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) (OR\u202f=\u202f0.27, 95% CI [0.17, 0.44], <i>p</i>\u202f<\u202f0.00001), indicating both therapeutic benefits and acceptable toxicity profiles. Neoadjuvant immunotherapy shows promise in the treatment of resectable HCC. Nonetheless, to further validate its efficacy, more large-scale, well-designed clinical trials are necessary to provide conclusive evidence. This comprehensive review adheres to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) standards and has been carried out as per a preregistered protocol (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42024560660).\n\nConsider:\n1.

Traditionally, HSD has been regarded as a major risk factor for multiple health issues, including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, cancer, and osteoporosis. However, recent studies have uncovered a novel aspect of HSD, suggesting that HSD may inhibit tumor growth in specific pathological conditions by modulating the activity of immune cells that infiltrate tumors and enhancing the effectiveness of PD-1 immunotherapy. This review focused on the duel molecular mechanisms of HSD in cancer development, which are based on the tumor microenvironment, the gut microbiota, and the involvement of sodium transporter channels. The objective of this review is to explore whether HSD could be a potential future oncological therapeutic strategy under specific situation.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

This review article delves into the mechanisms of peptide presentation by MHC molecules, particularly emphasizing the roles of ncRNA-derived peptides and extracellular vesicles (EVs) in shaping the immunopeptidome landscape. We explore established and emerging insights into MHC molecule interactions with peptides, including the dynamics of peptide loading, transport, and the influence of cellular and genetic variations. The article highlights novel research on non-coding RNA (ncRNA)-derived peptides, which challenge conventional views of antigen processing and presentation and the role of EVs in transporting these peptides, thereby modulating immune responses at remote body sites. This novel research not only challenges conventional views but also opens up new avenues for understanding immune responses. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of these mechanisms in developing therapeutic strategies, particularly for cancer immunotherapy. By conducting a comprehensive analysis of current literature and advanced methodologies in immunopeptidomics, this review aims to deepen the understanding of the complex interplay between MHC peptide presentation and the immune system, offering new perspectives on potential diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Additionally, the interactions between ncRNA-derived peptides and EVs provide a mechanism for the enhanced surface presentation of these peptides and highlight a novel pathway for their systemic distribution, potentially altering immune surveillance and therapeutic landscapes.\n\nConsider:\n1.

The use of omalizumab helps prevent anaphylaxis and improves the patient's ability to tolerate the allergen. Rapid desensitization offers significant time and cost savings.

Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) is a promising treatment, especially for children. Few studies currently exist related to optimal dosing for <i>Blomia tropicalis</i>. This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of SLIT to treat house dust mite-induced Allergic Rhinitis (AR). A total of 65 patients, ages 12-16 years, were treated for 12 months and randomized into SLIT versus placebo. The SLIT group received a combination of <i>Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus</i> and <i>Blomia tropicalis</i> allergens. Sensitization was confirmed by skin prick test or serum specific IgE. Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS), Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ), current treatment, and need for medication to control symptoms were ascertained during the study. Total serum IgE, serum specific IgE, and IgG4 levels for <i>Der p</i> 1 and <i>Blo t</i> were assessed at baseline and, 6 and 12 months after treatment. There was no significant difference in the number of adverse events between groups. The SLIT group showed a significant reduction in antihistamine use to control symptoms (p\xa0<\xa00.0001) compared to placebo. There was no significant change in serum total IgE, serum specific IgE, and IgG4 for either allergen when comparing the SLIT and placebo groups. After 1 year, SLIT using a dose of 1 mcg of Der p 1/day and 753 UBE of Blo t/day lowered the need for medications for break-through symptoms, with a good safety profile."\n\nConsider:\n1.

Its occurrence in patients with solid tumors on active antineoplastic treatment poses a significant clinical challenge. Given the lack of consensus on the optimal therapy for arterial thrombosis in cancer patients, the best practices for managing an aortic thrombus, and the benefit of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) must be reviewed. We present the case of a 70-year-old female with stage IVA lung adenocarcinoma who developed an aortic thrombus during chemo-immunotherapy. The thrombus was successfully treated with LMWH, avoiding further complications, and allowing for the continuation of her cancer therapy. This case highlights the importance of early detection and management of arterial thrombus in cancer patients. LMWH proved effective in resolving the thrombus, underscoring its role in managing such complications.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2. Study type and methodology\n3.

Huge HCC, a subtype characterized by tumors measuring at least 10 cm in diameter, often presents with macrovascular invasion, satellite nodules, metastases, and other aggressive characteristics, posing significant challenges for treatment. The era of combined targeted therapy and immunotherapy has brought new hope to patients with advanced HCC. The development of innovative combination medication regimens for HCC is a current area of intense clinical research interest. We are trying to explore new combination therapies based on target-immunity combination therapy in the hope of better-benefiting patients with advanced huge HCC. We present a patient with Barcelona Clinical Liver Cancer Stage C huge HCC who was treated with combined targeted therapy and immunotherapy as the primary therapeutic regimen, supplemented with tegafur long-term metronomic chemotherapy, as well as specialized adjuvant therapy such as thymosin, bisphosphonates, antiviral medication, and vitamin C supplementation. The tumor size was significantly reduced and microwave ablation was performed, after which, the patient was kept on the combination regimen, resulting in a partial response (PR), and maintaining PR without disease progression for 32 months. The combination regimen may enhance advanced huge HCC treatment and provide a new multimodal drug strategy for HCC.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

In a retrospective single-center study the results of sPDT with 5-ALA in 10 patients (6 of 10 were male), aged 30 to 62 years (median: 51.5 years; 95% CI: 38-59 years) with recurrent malignant brain gliomas after standard therapy who underwent surgery during the period of 2020-2023 were analyzed. sPDT was conducted during 15 min using 5-ALA at a dosage of 20 mg/kg, a diode laser with a wavelength of 635 nm and power of 1 W, and the LFT-02-BIOSPEC unit (BIOSPEC, Russia). Three patients got repeated sPDT after 3, 7, and 15 months due to a relapse. The number of target points and the optimal position for intervention paths were determined according to the data of preoperative stereotactic MRI of the brain with contrast intensification using the CRW Precision stereotactic navigation system (Integra, USA) and intraoperative registration of the area with the highest intensity of protoporphyrin IX fluorescence along the path (according to fluorescence biospectroscopy). Glioblastoma (grade IV, WHO) was diagnosed in 7 patients, anaplastic astrocytoma (grade III, WHO) - in 3 persons. Genetic studies were performed for 9 patients, 7 of them had tumors without the <i>IDH1</i> gene mutation. None of the patients had a combined 1p/19q deletion. The median volume of the contrast-enhancing part of the recurrent tumor was 7.95 cm<sup>3</sup> (95% CI: 3.3-13.6 cm<sup>3</sup>). The median time to relapse after sPDT in patients with anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas was 14.5 and 6.5 months, respectively. The median survival time after sPDT in patients with glioblastomas was 15.8 months (95% CI: 0.5-20.1 months), and in patients with anaplastic astrocytomas - 46.3 months (95%, CI not specified). In the early postoperative period, two patients had motor aphasia and hemiparesis, which further regressed. The results of a small group of patients allow to consider sPDT with 5-ALA as a promising technique to treat patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas in functionally relevant brain areas and require further prospective assessment.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Expression subtypes of GBM samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were identified using BayesNM and compared with existing molecular subtypes of GBM. Biological features of the subtypes were determined by single-sample gene set enrichment analysis. Genomic and proteomic data from GBM samples were combined and Genomic Identification of Significant Targets in Cancer analysis was used to screen genes with recurrent somatic copy-number alterations phenomenon. The immune environment among subtypes was compared by assessing the expression of immune molecules and the infiltration of immune cells. Molecular subtypes adapted to immunotherapy were identified based on Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) score. Finally, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression was performed on the expression profiles of S2, S3 and S4 in TCGA-GBM and RPPA to determine the respective corresponding best predictive model. Four novel molecular subtypes were classified. Specifically, S1 exhibited a low proliferative profile; S2 exhibited the profile of high proliferation, IDH1 mutation, TP53 mutation and deletion; S3 was characterized by high immune scores, innate immunity and adaptive immune infiltration scores, with the lowest TIDE score and was most likely to benefit from immunotherapy; S4 was characterized by high proliferation, EGFR amplification, and high protein abundance, and was the most suitable subtype for bevacizumab. LASSO analysis constructed the best prediction model composed of 13 genes in S2 with an accuracy of 96.7%, and the prediction model consisting of 17 genes in S3 with an accuracy of 86.7%, and screened 14 genes as components of the best prediction model in S4 with an accuracy of 93%. To conclude, our study classified reproducible and robust molecular subtypes of GBM, and these findings might contribute to the identification of patients responding to immunotherapy, thereby improving GBM prognosis.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Expression subtypes of GBM samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were identified using BayesNM and compared with existing molecular subtypes of GBM. Biological features of the subtypes were determined by single-sample gene set enrichment analysis. Genomic and proteomic data from GBM samples were combined and Genomic Identification of Significant Targets in Cancer analysis was used to screen genes with recurrent somatic copy-number alterations phenomenon. The immune environment among subtypes was compared by assessing the expression of immune molecules and the infiltration of immune cells. Molecular subtypes adapted to immunotherapy were identified based on Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) score. Finally, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression was performed on the expression profiles of S2, S3 and S4 in TCGA-GBM and RPPA to determine the respective corresponding best predictive model. Four novel molecular subtypes were classified. Specifically, S1 exhibited a low proliferative profile; S2 exhibited the profile of high proliferation, IDH1 mutation, TP53 mutation and deletion; S3 was characterized by high immune scores, innate immunity and adaptive immune infiltration scores, with the lowest TIDE score and was most likely to benefit from immunotherapy; S4 was characterized by high proliferation, EGFR amplification, and high protein abundance, and was the most suitable subtype for bevacizumab. LASSO analysis constructed the best prediction model composed of 13 genes in S2 with an accuracy of 96.7%, and the prediction model consisting of 17 genes in S3 with an accuracy of 86.7%, and screened 14 genes as components of the best prediction model in S4 with an accuracy of 93%. To conclude, our study classified reproducible and robust molecular subtypes of GBM, and these findings might contribute to the identification of patients responding to immunotherapy, thereby improving GBM prognosis.\n\nProvide a focused summary that:\n1.

To address these issues and personalise treatment approaches, we aimed to develop and validate robust multiomics molecular subtypes of IDHwt-GBM. Through this, we sought to uncover the distinct molecular signatures underlying these subtypes, paving the way for improved diagnosis and targeted therapy for this challenging disease. To identify stable molecular subtypes among 184 IDHwt-GBM patients from TCGA, we used the consensus clustering method to consolidate the results from ten advanced multiomics clustering approaches based on mRNA, lncRNA, and mutation data. We developed subtype prediction models using the PAM and machine learning algorithms based on mRNA and MRI data for enhanced clinical utility. These models were validated in five independent datasets, and an online interactive system was created. We conducted a comprehensive assessment of the clinical impact, drug treatment response, and molecular associations of the IDHwt-GBM subtypes. In the TCGA cohort, two molecular subtypes, class 1 and class 2, were identified through multiomics clustering of IDHwt-GBM patients. There was a significant difference in survival between Class 1 and Class 2 patients, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.68 [1.15-2.47]. This difference was validated in other datasets (CGGA: HR\u2009=\u20091.75[1.04, 2.94]; CPTAC: HR\u2009=\u20091.79[1.09-2.91]; GALSS: HR\u2009=\u20091.66[1.09-2.54]; UCSF: HR\u2009=\u20091.33[1.00-1.77]; UPENN HR\u2009=\u20091.29[1.04-1.58]). Additionally, class 2 was more sensitive to treatment with radiotherapy combined with temozolomide, and this sensitivity was validated in the GLASS cohort. Correspondingly, class 2 and class 1 exhibited significant differences in mutation patterns, enriched pathways, programmed cell death (PCD), and the tumour immune microenvironment. Class 2 had more mutation signatures associated with defective DNA mismatch repair (P\u2009=\u20090.0021). Enriched pathways of differentially expressed genes in class 1 and class 2 (P-adjust\u2009<\u20090.05) were mainly related to ferroptosis, the PD-1 checkpoint pathway, the JAK-STAT signalling pathway, and other programmed cell death and immune-related pathways. The different cell death modes and immune microenvironments were validated across multiple datasets. Finally, our developed survival prediction model, which integrates molecular subtypes, age, and sex, demonstrated clinical benefits based on the decision curve in the test set. We deployed the molecular subtyping prediction model and survival prediction model online, allowing interactive use and facilitating user convenience. Molecular subtypes were identified and verified through multiomics clustering in IDHwt-GBM patients. These subtypes are linked to specific mutation patterns, the immune microenvironment, prognoses, and treatment responses.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

There are limited reports on the immune profile of these tumors. In this study, we assessed 21 PXA [15 PXA Grade 2 (PXAG2); 6 PXA Grade 3 (PXAG3)] and 14 eGB for their histopathological and molecular association. Further, their immune profile was compared with GB, IDH1 wild-type (wt) (n-18). Morphologically, PXAG2 mostly differed from eGB; however, it was occasionally difficult to differentiate PXAG3 from eGB due to their epithelioid pattern and less obvious degenerative features. PXAG2 showed predominantly diffuse, whereas variable positivity for epithelial and glial markers was seen in PXAG3 and eGB. All cases showed retained nuclear ATRX and INI-1 . H3K27M or IDH1 mutation was seen in none. P53 mutation was more common in eGB, followed by PXAG3, and least common in PXAG2. BRAF V600E mutation was observed in 66.67% PXAG2, 33.33% PXAG3, and 50% eGB, with 100% concordance between immunohistochemistry (IHC) and sequencing. Thirty-six percent eGB, 33% PXAG3, and 61% PXAG2 harbored CDKN2A homozygous deletion. EGFR amplification was observed in 14% eGB and 66% of GB, IDH wt. PDL1 and CTLA-4 expression was higher in eGB (71.4% and 57.1%), PXAG3 (66.6% and100%), and PXAG2 (60% & 66.7%) as compared with GB, IDH wt (38.8% and 16.7%). Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were also observed in a majority of eGB and PXA (90% to 100%) in contrast to GB, IDH wt (66%). This analysis highlights the homogenous molecular and immune profile of eGB and PXA, suggesting the possibility that histologically and molecularly, these two entities represent 2 ends of a continuous spectrum with PXAG3 lying in between. Higher upregulation of PDL1, CTLA-4, and increased tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in these tumors as compared with GB, IDH wt suggests potential candidature for immunotherapy.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Through prospective genomic profiling of 459 consecutive primary treatment-naïve IDH-wildtype glioblastomas in adults, we identified a unique subgroup (2%, 9/459) defined by somatic hypermutation and DNA replication repair deficiency due to biallelic inactivation of a canonical mismatch repair gene. The deleterious mutations in mismatch repair genes were often present in the germline in the heterozygous state with somatic inactivation of the remaining allele, consistent with glioblastomas arising due to underlying Lynch syndrome. A subset of tumors had accompanying proofreading domain mutations in the DNA polymerase POLE and resultant "ultrahypermutation". The median age at diagnosis was 50 years (range 27-78), compared with 63 years for the other 450 patients with conventional glioblastoma (p\u2009<\u20090.01). All tumors had histologic features of the giant cell variant of glioblastoma. They lacked EGFR amplification, lacked combined trisomy of chromosome 7 plus monosomy of chromosome 10, and only rarely had TERT promoter mutation or CDKN2A homozygous deletion, which are hallmarks of conventional IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. Instead, they harbored frequent inactivating mutations in TP53, NF1, PTEN, ATRX, and SETD2 and recurrent activating mutations in PDGFRA. DNA methylation profiling revealed they did not align with known reference adult glioblastoma methylation classes, but instead had unique globally hypomethylated epigenomes and mostly classified as "Diffuse pediatric-type high grade glioma, RTK1 subtype, subclass A". Five patients were treated with immune checkpoint blockade, four of whom survived greater than 3\xa0years. The median overall survival was 36.8 months, compared to 15.5 months for the other 450 patients (p\u2009<\u20090.001). We conclude that "De novo replication repair deficient glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype" represents a biologically distinct subtype in the adult population that may benefit from prospective identification and treatment with immune checkpoint blockade.\n\nConsider:\n1.

This may guide a molecularly targeted strategy for the treatment of glioblastoma (GBM). We retrospectively analysed data obtained using FoundationOne®CDx in a large cohort of IDH1/2 wild-type GBM. We aimed to 1) identify potentially actionable molecular alterations at diagnosis and/or recurrence based on ESMO Scale for Clinical Actionability of Molecular Targets (ESCAT) defined categories of targetability, 2) understand the clinical implications of NGS in terms of access to and activity of targeted therapies. In 442 samples, an NGS profile was available in 98.2%. The median time from diagnosis to NGS profiling was 7.4 months (interquartile range (IQR): 3.4-13.2). Although about half of the patients had at least one actionable molecular alteration, only 3.4% of them were classified as ESCAT IB-IC and 6.7% as ESCAT IIB. Only 36 patients (10.5%) received personalised treatment in clinical trials or as off-label/compassionate use from second-line (median line 3). Most patients did not receive targeted therapy due to clinical deterioration/death (49.6%). Patients treated with dabrafenib/trametinib (9 patients) had the highest disease control rate of 77% and an objective response rate of 22%, with a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 5.2 months. No complete/partial responses were seen with the other regimens. 4/9 (44.4%) patients on anti-BRAF/anti-MEK, 2/4 patients (50%) on erdafitinib and 1/1 patient on capmatinib had a PFS ratio >\xa01.3. One recurrent GBM patient with ROS1-GOCP fusion maintained a complete response for 11.3 months on entrectinib. Our study demonstrated the feasibility of NGS in GBM samples. As the number of clinically relevant targets was limited and only a small group of GBM patients were treated with targeted therapy, NGS testing should be performed in the context of clinical trials. Our results support the activity of anti-BRAF/anti-MEK, while for the other agents prospective study results are needed to draw solid conclusions.\n\nConsider:\n1.

The mutational spectrum and DNA methylation patterns are homogeneous within de novo pAIDHmut/G4 and evolved sAIDHmut/G4, but the two groups have different diagnoses, management, and outcomes. This study sought to systematically compare the clinical, pathological, and survival characteristics between them. Of the 871 grade 4 astrocytomas with data for IDH mutation, 698 (80.1%) were primary and 173 (19.9%) were secondary. Of the 698 primary tumors, 103 (14.8%) were pAIDHmut/G4, and of the 173 secondary tumors, 108 (62.4%) were sAIDHmut/G4. Clinical, pathological, and survival features were compared between pAIDHmut/G4 and sAIDHmut/G4. Multivariate analyses were performed to identify prognostic factors. Patients with sAIDHmut/G4 had significantly shorter median overall survival (OS; 11.8 vs 34.2 months, hazard ratio [HR] 2.69, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.367-5.306, p = 0.004) and progression-free survival (PFS; 8.5 vs 24.3 months, HR 2.83, 95% CI 1.532-5.235, p = 0.001) than patients with pAIDHmut/G4. In patients with sAIDHmut/G4, resection status and chemotherapy were independent prognostic factors for OS and PFS; in patients with pAIDHmut/G4, LGG component, resection status, and O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase promoter methylation were independent prognostic factors. The therapeutic strategies of LGGs did not influence survival of patients with sAIDHmut/G4, but patients who had not received radiotherapy or chemotherapy when they were diagnosed with LGGs were found to benefit from radiotherapy or chemotherapy when they progressed to sAIDHmut/G4. The different clinical characteristics, survival, and risk factors between sAIDHmut/G4 and pAIDHmut/G4 provide a reference to guide treatment decisions in AIDHmut/G4.\n\nConsider:\n1.

The genetic characteristic still remains unclear until now. We reported a 47-year-old female patient with multiple intracranial disseminations and infiltrations (splenium of the corpus callosum and lateral ventricular wall) of a rapid progressive glioblastoma underwent occipital craniotomy and total resection of all the enhancing lesions. Whole-exome sequencing and pathological examination revealed glioblastoma, IDH1 wild type, PTEN deficient, TERT mutated, NF1mutated, MGMT unmethylated. After surgery, the patient received combined therapeutic regimen of TTFields (tumor-treating fields) plus pembrolizumab plus temozolomide and TTFields plus everolimus, which displayed significant clinical benefits. During the combined therapeutic course, an extremely rare secondary malignant neoplasm occurred, femur MR and pathological detection of biopsy tissue demonstrated osteosarcoma. The result of whole-exome sequencing revealed 7 germline mutated genes (EPAS1, SETD2, MSH3, BMPR1A, ERCC4, CDH1, AR). Bioinformatic analysis showed the two germline mutations (MSH3 and ERCC4) induced deficiency in the DNA repair machinery, which resulting in the accumulation of mutations and may generate neoantigens contributing to the development of a secondary osteosarcoma in this case. Individualized combination therapies based on whole-exome sequencing displayed significant clinical benefits in this case. Germline MSH3 and ERCC4 mutation may induce a secondary osteosarcoma in glioblastoma patients.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2. Study type and methodology\n3.

TP53 is the most common mutated gene in human cancer, occurring in 30-50% of glioblastomas (GBM). Here, we highlight a precision medicine platform to identify potential targets for a GBM patient with LFS. We used a comparative transcriptomics approach to identify genes that are uniquely overexpressed in the LFS GBM patient relative to a cancer compendium of 12,747 tumor RNA sequencing data sets, including 200 GBMs. STAT1 and STAT2 were identified as being significantly overexpressed in the LFS patient, indicating ruxolitinib, a Janus kinase 1 and 2 inhibitors, as a potential therapy. The LFS patient had the highest level of STAT1 and STAT2 expression in an institutional high-grade glioma cohort of 45 patients, further supporting the cancer compendium results. To empirically validate the comparative transcriptomics pipeline, we used a combination of adherent and organoid cell culture techniques, including ex vivo patient-derived organoids (PDOs) from four patient-derived cell lines, including the LFS patient. STAT1 and STAT2 expression levels in the four patient-derived cells correlated with levels identified in the respective parent tumors. In both adherent and organoid cultures, cells from the LFS patient were among the most sensitive to ruxolitinib compared to patient-derived cells with lower STAT1 and STAT2 expression levels. A spheroid-based drug screening assay (3D-PREDICT) was performed and used to identify further therapeutic targets. Two targeted therapies were selected for the patient of interest and resulted in radiographic disease stability. This manuscript supports the use of comparative transcriptomics to identify personalized therapeutic targets in a functional precision medicine platform for malignant brain tumors.\n\nConsider:\n1.

However, large databases with tissue metabolites that are modulated by IDH1 mutation remain an area of development. Here, we present an unprecedented and valuable resource for tissue metabolites in diffuse glioma and their modulations by IDH1 mutation, histology, and tumor treatments in 101 tissue samples from 73 diffuse glioma patients (24 astrocytoma, 17 oligodendroglioma, 32 glioblastoma), investigated by NMR-based metabolomics and supported by RNA-Seq. We discovered comparison-specific metabolites and pathways modulated by IDH1 (IDH1 mutation status cohort) and tumor entity. The Longitudinal investigation cohort provides metabolic profiles of untreated and corresponding treated glioma samples at first progression. Most interestingly, univariate and multivariate cox regressions and Kaplan-Meier analyses revealed that tissue metabolites correlate with progression-free and overall survival. Thus, this study introduces potentially novel candidate prognostic and surrogate metabolite biomarkers for future prospective clinical studies, aiming at further refining patient stratification in diffuse glioma. Furthermore, our data will facilitate the generation of so-far-unanticipated hypotheses for experimental studies to advance our molecular understanding of glioma biology.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Currently, tumour heterogeneity and mutation acquisition are major impedances for tailoring personalized therapy. We collected blood and tumour tissue samples from 25 GBM patients and 25 blood samples from healthy controls. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) was extracted from the plasma of GBM patients and from healthy controls. Tumour DNA was extracted from fresh tumour samples. Extracted DNA was sequenced using a whole-genome sequencing procedure. We also collected 180 tumour DNA datasets from GBM patients publicly available at the TCGA/PANCANCER project. These data were analysed for mutations and gene-gene fusions that could be potential druggable targets. We found that plasma cfDNA concentrations in GBM patients were significantly elevated (22.6 ± 5 ng·mL<sup>-1</sup> ), as compared to healthy controls (1.4\u2009±\u20090.4\u2009ng·mL<sup>-1</sup> ) of the same average age. We identified unique mutations in the cfDNA and tumour DNA of each GBM patient, including some of the most frequently mutated genes in GBM according to the COSMIC database (TP53, 18.75%; EGFR, 37.5%; NF1, 12.5%; LRP1B, 25%; IRS4, 25%). Using our gene-gene fusion database, ChiTaRS 5.0, we identified gene-gene fusions in cfDNA and tumour DNA, such as KDR-PDGFRA and NCDN-PDGFRA, which correspond to previously reported alterations of PDGFRA in GBM (44% of all samples). Interestingly, the PDGFRA protein fusions can be targeted by tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as imatinib, sunitinib, and sorafenib. Moreover, we identified BCR-ABL1 (in 8% of patients), COL1A1-PDGFB (8%), NIN-PDGFRB (8%), and FGFR1-BCR (4%) in cfDNA of patients, which can be targeted by analogues of imatinib. ROS1 fusions (CEP85L-ROS1 and GOPC-ROS1), identified in 8% of patient cfDNA, might be targeted by crizotinib, entrectinib, or larotrectinib. Thus, our study suggests that integrated analysis of cfDNA plasma concentration, gene mutations, and gene-gene fusions can serve as a diagnostic modality for distinguishing GBM patients who may benefit from targeted therapy. These results open new avenues for precision medicine in GBM, using noninvasive liquid biopsy diagnostics to assess personalized patient profiles. Moreover, repeated detection of druggable targets over the course of the disease may provide real-time information on the evolving molecular landscape of the tumour.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Despite its poor prognosis, its rarity has precluded analysis of its underlying biology. We used a multi-center database to characterize the genomic landscape of gliosarcoma. Sequencing data was obtained from 35 gliosarcoma patients from Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange (GENIE) 5.0, a database curated by the American Association of Cancer Research (AACR). We analyzed genomic alterations in gliosarcomas and compared them to GBM (n\u2009=\u20091,449) and soft tissue sarcoma (n\u2009=\u20091,042). 30 samples were included (37% female, median age 59 [IQR: 49-64]). Nineteen common genes were identified in gliosarcoma, defined as those altered in\u2009>\u20095% of samples, including TERT Promoter (92%), PTEN (66%), and TP53 (60%). Of the 19 common genes in gliosarcoma, 6 were also common in both GBM and soft tissue sarcoma, 4 in GBM alone, 0 in soft tissue sarcoma alone, and 9 were more distinct to gliosarcoma. Of these, BRAF harbored an OncoKB level 1 designation, indicating its status as a predictive biomarker of response to an FDA-approved drug in certain cancers. EGFR, CDKN2A, NF1, and PTEN harbored level 4 designations in solid tumors, indicating biological evidence of these biomarkers predicting a drug-response. Gliosarcoma contains molecular features that overlap GBM and soft tissue sarcoma, as well as its own distinct genomic signatures. This may play a role in disease classification and inclusion criteria for clinical trials. Gliosarcoma mutations with potential therapeutic indications include BRAF, EGFR, CDKN2A, NF1, and PTEN.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2. Study type and methodology\n3.

Thirty adults with H3.3 G34-mutant diffuse gliomas were retrospectively reviewed for clinical and pathologic information. Molecular profiling using next-generation sequencing was performed in 29 of the 30 H3.3 G34-mutant patients with 1 patient lacking available tumor samples, as well as 82 IDH/H3 wild-type adult diffuse glioma patients. The age at diagnosis of H3.3 G34-mutant diffuse gliomas was significantly younger than IDH/H3 wild-type gliomas (24 vs. 57\u2009y, P<0.001). Overall, 19 of the 30 patients were diagnosed of glioblastoma with the primitive neuronal component, and 8 were glioblastoma. The molecular profiling analysis revealed higher frequencies of Olig-2 loss of expression, TP53 mutation, ATRX mutation, PDGFRA mutation, and MGMT promoter methylation (P<0.05) in H3.3 G34-mutant gliomas than IDH/H3 wild-type gliomas. No TERT promoter mutation and only 1 case of EGFR amplification were detected in the H3.3 G34-mutant cohort, the frequencies of which were significantly higher in the IDH/H3 wild-type cohort. A dismal prognosis was observed in H3.3 G34-mutant patients comparing to IDH/H3 wild-type cohort (overall survival: 14 vs. 22\u2009mo; P=0.026). Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that the extent of resection and TP53 mutation were independently affecting prognosis. The distinct pathologic and molecular features of H3.3 G34-mutant diffuse gliomas in adult patients demonstrated the clinical importance of detecting H3.3 G34R/V mutations. The dismal prognosis of this rare high-grade glioma disease we reported here would further promote the investigation of dedicated therapeutic strategies.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Immune therapy has proven effective across different cancers with remarkable response rates. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) is a marker of response, but technical and methodological differences in TMB estimates have made a proper assessment and comparison challenging. Here, we analyzed a prospective collection of paired samples from 35 patients with newly diagnosed GBM, all of whom were wild-type (WT) for isocitrate dehydrogenase, before and after treatment with radiotherapy and temozolomide. Seven patients (20%) had O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase-methylated tumors. Six patients (17%) had two relapse surgeries, and tissue from all three surgeries was collected. We found that accurate evaluation of TMB was confounded by high variability in the cancer cell fraction of relapse samples. To ameliorate this, we developed a model to adjust for tumor purity based on the relative density distribution of variant allele frequencies in each primary-relapse pair. Additionally, we examined the mutation spectra of shared and private mutations. After tumor purity adjustment, we found TMB comparison reliable in tumors with tumor purity between 15% and 40%, resulting in 27/35 patients (77.1%). TMB remained unchanged from 0.65 mutations per megabase (Mb) to 0.67/Mb before and after treatment, respectively. Examination of the mutation spectra revealed a dominance of C\u2009>\u2009T transitions at CpG sites in both shared and relapse-private mutations, consistent with cytosine deamination and the clock-like mutational signature 1. We present and apply a cellularity correction approach that enables more accurate assessment of TMB in paired tumor samples. We did not find a significant increase in TMB after correcting for cancer cell fraction. Our study raises significant concerns when determining TMB. Although a small sample size, corrected TMB can have a clinical significance when stratifying patients to experimental treatment, for example, immune checkpoint therapy.\n\nConsider:\n1.

A phase III clinical trial showed that tumor treating fields (TTFields) monotherapy provided comparable survival benefits to physician's chemotherapy choice in rGBM. However, patients did not equally benefit from TTFields, highlighting the importance of identifying predictive biomarkers of TTFields efficacy. A retrospective review of an institutional database with 530 patients with infiltrating gliomas was performed. Patients with IDH-WT rGBM receiving TTFields at first recurrence were included. Tumors were evaluated by next-generation sequencing for mutations in 205 cancer-related genes. Post-progression survival (PPS) was examined using the log-rank test and multivariate Cox-regression analysis. 149 rGBM patients were identified of which 29 (19%) were treated with TTFields. No significant difference in median PPS was observed between rGBM patients who received versus did not receive TTFields (13.9 versus 10.9\xa0months, p\u2009=\u20090.068). However, within the TTFields-treated group (n\u2009=\u200929), PPS was improved in PTEN-mutant (n\u2009=\u200914) versus PTEN-WT (n\u2009=\u200915) rGBM, (22.2 versus 11.6\xa0months, p\u2009=\u20090.017). Within the PTEN-mutant group (n\u2009=\u200970, 47%), patients treated with TTFields (n\u2009=\u200914) had longer median PPS (22.2 versus 9.3\xa0months, p\u2009=\u20090.005). No PPS benefit was observed in PTEN-WT patients receiving TTFields (n\u2009=\u200979, 53%). TTFields therapy conferred a significant PPS benefit in PTEN-mutant rGBM. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underpinning the differences in response to TTFields therapy could help elucidate the mechanism of action of TTFields and identify the rGBM patients most likely to benefit from this therapeutic option.\n\nConsider:\n1.

As several ongoing studies are investigating T-cell based immunotherapy in GBM, we conducted this study to assess whether peritumoral edema with potentially increased intracranial pressure, disrupted tissue homeostasis and reduced local blood flow has influence on immune infiltration and affects survival. A volumetric analysis of preoperative imaging (gadolinium enhanced T1 weighted MRI sequences for tumor size and T2 weighted sequences for extent of edema (including the infiltrative zone, gliosis etc.) was conducted in 144 patients using the Brainlab® software. Immunohistochemical staining was analyzed for lymphocytic- (CD 3+) and myelocytic (CD15+) tumor infiltration. A retrospective analysis of patient-, surgical-, and molecular characteristics was performed using medical records. The edema to tumor ratio was neither associated with progression-free nor overall survival (p=0.90, p=0.74). However, GBM patients displaying IDH-1 wildtype had significantly higher edema to tumor ratio than patients displaying an IDH-1 mutation (p=0.01). Immunohistopathological analysis did not show significant differences in lymphocytic or myelocytic tumor infiltration (p=0.78, p=0.74) between these groups. In our cohort, edema to tumor ratio had no significant correlation with immune infiltration and outcome. However, patients with an IDH-1wildtype GBM had a significantly higher edema to tumor ratio compared to their IDH-1 mutated peer group. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the underlying mechanisms.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2. Study type and methodology\n3. Population characteristics\n4.

Low levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are beneficial for cells and have anti-cancer effects. ROS are produced in the mitochondria during ATP production by oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). In the present review, we describe ATP production in primary brain tumors, glioblastoma, in relation to ROS production. Differentiated glioblastoma cells mainly use glycolysis for ATP production (aerobic glycolysis) without ROS production, whereas glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) in hypoxic periarteriolar niches use OXPHOS for ATP and ROS production, which is modest because of the hypoxia and quiescence of GSCs. In a significant proportion of glioblastoma, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (<i>IDH1</i>) is mutated, causing metabolic rewiring, and all cancer cells use OXPHOS for ATP and ROS production. Systemic therapeutic inhibition of glycolysis is not an option as clinical trials have shown ineffectiveness or unwanted side effects. We argue that systemic therapeutic inhibition of OXPHOS is not an option either because the anti-cancer effects of ROS production in healthy cells is inhibited as well. Therefore, we advocate to remove GSCs out of their hypoxic niches by the inhibition of their binding to niches to enable their differentiation and thus increase their sensitivity to radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy.\n\nConsider:\n1.

We aimed to investigate the biological and clinical factors that affect survival in Turkish patients with primary GBM. The clinical and demographic data of all patients with primary GBM diagnosed between 2007 and 2016 were evaluated. In all the patients? pathological specimens, O6 methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) methylation and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 mutation were detected retrospectively by immunohistochemistry. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, log-rank test, and multivariate analyses of the Cox hazard proportional model for all the variables were performed using the SPSS statistical package. The treatment details and other patient-related factors were identified, and their correlations were analyzed. We enrolled 137 primary GBM patients to the study. Median progression free survival (PFS) was 8.57 months (95% CI:6.8-9.5) and median overall survival (OS) was 12 months (95% CI:10.8-13.3). IDH-1 mutations were detected in 21 primary GBMs (15.3%). PFS was 15.43 ± 1.95 months. Survival rates were higher, but no statistically significant difference (p=0.074). MGMT methylation was detected in 40 primary GBMs (29.2%). OS and PFS of MGMT (+) cases were higher than MGMT(-) cases (p=0.001; p=0.001 respectively). Ki67 (%) measurement (10%-90%) average is 32.64 ± 16.56. No statistically significant between higher and lower ki67 levels (p=0.510, p=0.505 respectively). KPS (%) more than 70 at the time of diagnosis statistically significant longer median OS and PFS (p=0.001). PFS and OS were higher in all treatment modalities. The most important factors that affected survival were performance score, MGMT methylation status, systemic oncologic therapy, and IDH mutation in the Turkish population with primary GBM. We demonstrated that MGMT methylation and higher KPS levels were associated with significiantly longer OS and PFS.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2. Study type and methodology\n3.

Using Illumina sequencing of 812 cancer-associated genes, researchers identified key mutations across different glioma grades. In low-grade gliomas (LGG, n=18), frequent mutations included **IDH1/2 (78%)**, **TP53 (44%)**, and **ATRX (33%)**, while high-grade gliomas (HGG, n=113) exhibited **EGFR (40%)**, **PTEN (60%)**, **TP53 (27%)**, and **TERTp (71%)** mutations. **IDH1/2 mutations correlated with better prognosis**, whereas **TERTp mutations and PTEN deletions were linked to worse survival**. In IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, a history of prior cancer predicted poorer overall survival (OS), while **bevacizumab therapy and re-operation improved OS**. Nine patients received targeted therapy, but specific efficacy outcomes were not detailed. These findings underscore the prognostic value of molecular profiling in guiding glioblastoma treatment, particularly for therapies targeting EGFR, PTEN, and IDH mutations.\n\nArticle PMID:39085480\nThis study aimed to classify glioblastoma (GBM) into molecular subtypes to predict treatment response, particularly for immunotherapy and targeted treatments. Using TCGA data, BayesNM analysis, and gene/protein profiling, four novel subtypes were identified:\n\n- **S1**: Low proliferative profile.  \n- **S2**: High proliferation, IDH1/TP53 mutations, and deletions; best predicted by a 13-gene model (96.7% accuracy).  \n- **S3**: High immune infiltration and lowest Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) score, suggesting the greatest likelihood of benefiting from immunotherapy; best predicted by a 17-gene model (86.7% accuracy).  \n- **S4**: High proliferation, EGFR amplification, and high protein abundance; most responsive to bevacizumab; best predicted by a 14-gene model (93% accuracy).  \n\nThe study used genomic and proteomic data to correlate molecular features with treatment responses, identifying S3 as the most immunotherapy-responsive and S4 as best suited for bevacizumab. These findings provide a framework for personalized GBM treatment, improving prognostic accuracy and guiding therapy selection.\n\nArticle PMID:38890658\nThis study aimed to classify IDH1-wildtype glioblastoma (IDHwt-GBM) into molecular subtypes to improve prognosis prediction and guide treatment strategies. Using consensus clustering on multiomics data (mRNA, lncRNA, mutation) from 184 TCGA patients, two distinct subtypes (Class 1 and Class 2) were identified and validated across five independent datasets. Class 2 patients had better survival outcomes than Class 1 (TCGA HR = 1.68 [1.15-2.47]; CGGA HR = 1.75 [1.04-2.94]; CPTAC HR = 1.79 [1.09-2.91]; GALSS HR = 1.66 [1.09-2.54]; UCSF HR = 1.33 [1.00-1.77]; UPENN HR = 1.29 [1.04-1.58]) and showed greater sensitivity to radiotherapy plus temozolomide. Mutation analysis revealed Class 2 had more defective DNA mismatch repair signatures (P = 0.0021). Pathway enrichment showed differences in ferroptosis, PD-1 checkpoint, and JAK-STAT signaling, linking subtypes to immune microenvironment variations. A survival prediction model integrating subtype, age, and sex demonstrated clinical utility. These findings suggest that molecular subtyping could refine treatment strategies, particularly for immunotherapy and DNA repair-targeted therapies.\n\nArticle PMID:38326661\nThis multi-center retrospective study analyzed 157 patients (mean age 58 years, 36.9% female) with WHO grade 2-3 **IDH1/2 wildtype (wt) astrocytomas** who underwent surgery between 2016-2019. The study assessed **progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and prognostic factors**.\n\n### **Key Findings:**\n1. **Survival Outcomes:** Median **PFS was 12.5 months**, and **OS was 27.0 months**, with no significant difference between WHO grade 2 and 3 tumors.\n2. **Surgical Impact:** **Gross total resection (GTR) and subtotal resection (STR) significantly improved PFS (P < 0.01) and OS (P < 0.001)** compared to biopsy.\n3. **Treatment Response:** The **Stupp protocol (radiotherapy + temozolomide) did not improve OS or PFS** over chemotherapy or radiotherapy alone.\n4. **Molecular Markers:** **EGFR amplification (P = 0.014) and TERT-promoter mutation (P = 0.042) were associated with shorter OS**, while **MGMT-promoter methylation had no impact on treatment response**.\n5. **Prognostic Factors:** **Age, extent of resection, and strong EGFR expression were key prognostic indicators.**\n\n### **Clinical Implications:**\n- **IDH1/2-wt astrocytomas (WHO grade 2-3) behave aggressively, similar to GBM (WHO grade 4),** suggesting a need for more tailored treatment approaches.\n- **Surgical resection significantly improves outcomes**, reinforcing the importance of maximal safe resection.\n- **Standard GBM treatments (e.g., Stupp protocol) may not be optimal for IDH1/2-wt astrocytomas**, highlighting the need for alternative therapeutic strategies.\n- **EGFR amplification and TERT mutations may indicate poorer prognosis**, suggesting potential targets for future therapies.\n\nThis study underscores the **limited effectiveness of standard treatments in IDH1/2-wt astrocytomas** and the need for **biomarker-driven therapeutic approaches, including targeted therapies and immunotherapy**.\n\nArticle PMID:37161052\n### Summary: Influence of IDH1 Mutation on GBM Immunotherapy Effectiveness  \n\n**Main Findings & Conclusions:**  \nThis study identifies wild-type IDH1 as an enhancer of immunotherapy efficacy in glioblastoma (GBM), whereas the IDH1^R132H mutation impairs immune response. Wild-type IDH1 enhances T cell responses, promotes glioma cell lysis, and improves survival in GBM patients receiving vaccine therapy. In contrast, mutant IDH1^R132H lacks these effects, leading to reduced tumor cell killing and poorer survival outcomes.  \n\n**Methodology Overview:**  \nThe study included both animal and human data. Mouse models of glioma were used to assess vaccine efficacy in the presence of wild-type and mutant IDH1. In vitro experiments analyzed extracellular IDH1’s impact on T cell function and tumor cell lysis. Additionally, clinical data from GBM patients who received vaccine therapy were examined to correlate IDH1 status with survival.  \n\n**Population Characteristics:**  \nHuman data were derived from GBM patients undergoing vaccine therapy, stratified by IDH1 mutation status. Specific cohort sizes and demographics were not detailed in the abstract.  \n\n**Key Statistical Results:**  \n- Wild-type IDH1 enhanced T cell responses and glioma cell lysis.  \n- Mutant IDH1^R132H delayed tumor cell killing and was associated with decreased survival post-immunotherapy.  \n- IDH1 exhibited sialidase activity on CD8, a function lost in the mutant form, impairing T cell-mediated tumor attack.  \n\n**Clinical Implications:**  \nThese findings suggest that IDH1 mutation status could serve as a biomarker for predicting immunotherapy response in GBM. Patients with IDH1^R132H mutations may have reduced benefit from vaccine-based immunotherapies, necessitating alternative treatment strategies. Additionally, targeting IDH1’s immunomodulatory function could represent a novel therapeutic avenue for enhancing GBM immunotherapy efficacy.\n\nArticle PMID:36881002\n### Summary  \n\n**Main Findings & Conclusions:**  \nThis study demonstrates that GBM driver mutations influence the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and response to immunotherapy. Specifically, EGFRvIII-driven GBMs accumulate more polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs), leading to resistance to PD-1 and CTLA-4 checkpoint blockade therapy. Targeting the CXCL1/2/3–CXCR2 axis reduced systemic PMN-MDSCs, improved immunotherapy response, and prolonged survival in EGFRvIII-driven GBM models. These findings support stratifying GBM patients for immunotherapy based on genetic and immune profiles.  \n\n**Methodology Overview:**  \nThe study used genetically engineered mouse models of GBM with EGFR wild-type and EGFRvIII mutations. Researchers analyzed TIME composition, immune cell accumulation, and therapeutic responses. Pharmacologic inhibition of the CXCL1/2/3–CXCR2 axis was tested for its impact on immune cell dynamics and survival outcomes.  \n\n**Population Characteristics:**  \nClinically relevant murine models of GBM were used, with comparisons between EGFR wild-type and EGFRvIII-driven tumors. Human relevance is inferred but not directly studied.  \n\n**Key Statistical Results:**  \n- EGFRvIII-driven GBMs showed significantly higher PMN-MDSC accumulation over time.  \n- Pharmacologic blockade of CXCR2 led to a systemic reduction in PMN-MDSCs.  \n- Combination PD-1/CTLA-4 therapy was more effective following CXCR2 inhibition, leading to prolonged survival in EGFRvIII-driven GBM models (specific survival data not provided in the abstract).  \n\n**Clinical Implications:**  \nEGFRvIII mutations contribute to immunotherapy resistance via PMN-MDSC accumulation. Targeting the CXCL1/2/3–CXCR2 axis may enhance checkpoint blockade efficacy in EGFRvIII-positive GBM. These findings suggest that integrating genetic (e.g., EGFRvIII status) and immune profiling could optimize immunotherapy strategies for GBM patients.\n\nArticle PMID:34969742\nThis study retrospectively analyzed 316 patients with IDH-wildtype glioblastoma (GBM) to evaluate the impact of MGMT promoter methylation on treatment response and survival. MGMT methylation was significantly associated with ATRX loss and completion of the standard Stupp protocol. Patients were categorized into unmethylated, low-methylated (10-39%), and hypermethylated (≥40%) groups. Median overall survival was 15, 23, and 30 months, respectively, while median progression-free survival was 11, 18, and 21 months. However, the survival benefit in the hypermethylated group was not statistically significant. These findings suggest MGMT methylation influences temozolomide response and may correlate with ATRX mutations, which could impact treatment strategies.\n\nArticle PMID:34875133\nThis study investigated the mutational landscape of glioblastoma (GBM) using whole-genome sequencing on tumor DNA and cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from 25 GBM patients and 25 healthy controls, supplemented by 180 publicly available tumor DNA datasets. The researchers found significantly elevated cfDNA concentrations in GBM patients (22.6 ± 5 ng/mL) compared to controls (1.4 ± 0.4 ng/mL). Frequently mutated genes included **EGFR (37.5%), TP53 (18.75%), NF1 (12.5%), LRP1B (25%), and IRS4 (25%)**. Additionally, gene-gene fusions such as **KDR-PDGFRA and NCDN-PDGFRA (44% of samples)** were identified, which are targetable with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (e.g., imatinib, sunitinib, sorafenib). Other druggable fusions included **BCR-ABL1 (8%), COL1A1-PDGFB (8%), NIN-PDGFRB (8%), FGFR1-BCR (4%)**, and **ROS1 fusions (8%)**, which may respond to crizotinib, entrectinib, or larotrectinib.\n\n### Clinical Implications:\n1. **Targeted Therapy:** Identified mutations and fusions suggest potential for personalized treatment using tyrosine kinase inhibitors.\n2. **Liquid Biopsy Utility:** cfDNA analysis provides a **noninvasive** method for detecting actionable mutations, offering real-time tumor monitoring.\n3. **Precision Medicine:** Repeated cfDNA testing could track tumor evolution and therapy resistance, guiding treatment adjustments.\n\nThis study underscores the potential of **liquid biopsy for GBM precision medicine**, particularly in selecting patients for emerging targeted therapies. However, it does not address immunotherapy or tumor-treating fields (TTF) directly.\n\nArticle PMID:34578259\nThis study evaluates the efficacy of R-613, an oncolytic herpes simplex virus (HSV) specifically retargeted to EGFRvIII-mutant glioblastoma (GBM). Using an orthotopic xenograft mouse model implanted with human EGFRvIII-expressing GBM cells, the researchers assessed R-613\'s specificity, safety, and therapeutic potential.  \n\n### **Main Findings & Conclusions:**  \n- Early treatment with R-613 significantly extended median survival in mice with EGFRvIII-positive GBM.  \n- Tumor growth monitoring via a secreted luciferase reporter showed substantial tumor mass delay.  \n- Late-stage treatment was less effective, but explanted tumor cells remained susceptible ex vivo, suggesting potential benefits of multiple treatments.  \n- R-613 demonstrates promise as a targeted oncolytic virotherapy for EGFRvIII-positive GBM.  \n\n### **Methodology Overview:**  \n- **Model:** Orthotopic xenografts of human EGFRvIII-expressing GBM in mice.  \n- **Intervention:** Early vs. late administration of R-613.  \n- **Outcome Measures:** Median survival, tumor burden (via luciferase reporter), and ex vivo susceptibility to R-613.  \n\n### **Population Characteristics:**  \n- Human-derived GBM xenografts expressing EGFRvIII.  \n- Immunocompromised mice as hosts.  \n\n### **Key Statistical Results:**  \n- Early R-613 treatment **significantly increased median survival** (exact survival extension not specified in abstract).  \n- Tumor burden was **substantially reduced**, though quantitative values were not provided.  \n- Late treatment showed **diminished efficacy**, but remaining tumor cells retained susceptibility to R-613.  \n\n### **Clinical Implications:**  \n- **Targeted virotherapy for EGFRvIII-positive GBM** could improve outcomes, particularly with early intervention.  \n- **Multiple treatment cycles** may enhance efficacy, addressing residual tumor burden.  \n- Findings support further clinical investigation of R-613 as a **mutation-specific therapy** for GBM.  \n\nThis study underscores the importance of **mutation-specific approaches** in GBM treatment, particularly for EGFRvIII-targeted therapies, complementing existing modalities like immunotherapy and tumor-treating fields (TTF).\n\nArticle PMID:34498213\nThis study evaluated the effectiveness of osimertinib/bevacizumab in recurrent glioblastoma (GB) patients with **EGFR amplification and EGFRvIII mutation**. The retrospective analysis included **15 patients** (median age **56 years**, **67% male**), all of whom had prior **IMRT and temozolomide (median 9 cycles)**. \n\n### **Findings & Conclusions:**\n- The combination therapy had **limited overall efficacy**, though a subset of patients experienced **prolonged benefit**.\n- Resistance mechanisms included **MET amplification, STAT3, IGF1R, PTEN, and PDGFR alterations**, suggesting known **EGFR pathway adaptations**.\n\n### **Methodology:**\n- Patients received **osimertinib/bevacizumab** as a **second-line treatment** after recurrence.\n- Liquid biopsy and **next-generation sequencing** were used to assess resistance patterns.\n\n### **Key Statistical Results:**\n- **Median progression-free survival (PFS):** **5.1 months** (95% CI: 2.8-7.3).\n- **Median overall survival (OS):** **9.0 months** (95% CI: 3.9-14.0).\n- **PFS at 6 months (PFS6):** **46.7%**.\n- **Overall response rate (ORR):** **13.3%**.\n\n### **Clinical Implications:**\n- **EGFR-targeted therapy remains only marginally effective** in GB, even in biomarker-enriched populations.\n- Resistance mechanisms highlight the need for **combination strategies** targeting **secondary alterations**.\n- Findings support **further clinical trials** to refine EGFR-directed approaches.\n\nThis study underscores the **complex resistance landscape in GBM**, emphasizing the **need for multi-targeted therapies** beyond EGFR inhibition alone.\n\nProvide a comprehensive synthesis that:\n1.

The focus is on clinical utility to facilitate a practical understanding of these principles and how they can be used to guide treatment. The current evidence for a correlation between TTFields dose, tumor growth, and clinical outcome will be presented and discussed. Furthermore, we will provide perspectives and updated insights into the planning and optimization of TTFields therapy for glioblastoma by reviewing how the dose and thermal effects of TTFields are affected by factors such as tumor location and morphology, peritumoral edema, electrode array position, treatment duration (compliance), array "edge effect," electrical duty cycle, and skull-remodeling surgery.

Despite the standard of care therapy, which includes surgical resection, temozolomide chemotherapy, radiation and the newly added tumor-treating fields, median survival remains only ∼20 months. Unfortunately, GBM has a ∼100% recurrence rate, but after recurrence there are no Food and Drug Administration-approved therapies to limit tumor growth and enhance patient survival, as these tumors are resistant to temozolomide (TMZ). Recently, our laboratory reported that lucanthone slows GBM by inhibiting autophagic flux through lysosome targeting and decreases the number of Olig2+ glioma stem-like cells (GSC) in vitro and in vivo. We now additionally report that lucanthone efficiently abates stemness in patient-derived GSC and reduces tumor microtube formation in GSC, an emerging hallmark of treatment resistance in GBM. In glioma tumors derived from cells with acquired resistance to TMZ, lucanthone retains the ability to perturb tumor growth, inhibits autophagy by targeting lysosomes, and reduces Olig2 positivity. We also find that lucanthone may act as an inhibitor of palmitoyl protein thioesterase 1. Our results suggest that lucanthone may function as a potential treatment option for GBM tumors that are not amenable to TMZ treatment. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: We report that the antischistosome agent lucanthone impedes tumor growth in a preclinical model of temozolomide-resistant glioblastoma and reduces the numbers of stem-like glioma cells. In addition, it acts as an autophagy inhibitor, and its mechanism of action may be via inhibition of palmitoyl protein thioesterase 1. As there are no defined therapies approved for recurrent, TMZ-resistant tumor, lucanthone could emerge as a treatment for glioblastoma tumors that may not be amenable to TMZ both in the newly diagnosed and recurrent settings.\n\nConsider:\n1.

A phase III clinical trial showed that tumor treating fields (TTFields) monotherapy provided comparable survival benefits to physician's chemotherapy choice in rGBM. However, patients did not equally benefit from TTFields, highlighting the importance of identifying predictive biomarkers of TTFields efficacy. A retrospective review of an institutional database with 530 patients with infiltrating gliomas was performed. Patients with IDH-WT rGBM receiving TTFields at first recurrence were included. Tumors were evaluated by next-generation sequencing for mutations in 205 cancer-related genes. Post-progression survival (PPS) was examined using the log-rank test and multivariate Cox-regression analysis. 149 rGBM patients were identified of which 29 (19%) were treated with TTFields. No significant difference in median PPS was observed between rGBM patients who received versus did not receive TTFields (13.9 versus 10.9\xa0months, p\u2009=\u20090.068). However, within the TTFields-treated group (n\u2009=\u200929), PPS was improved in PTEN-mutant (n\u2009=\u200914) versus PTEN-WT (n\u2009=\u200915) rGBM, (22.2 versus 11.6\xa0months, p\u2009=\u20090.017). Within the PTEN-mutant group (n\u2009=\u200970, 47%), patients treated with TTFields (n\u2009=\u200914) had longer median PPS (22.2 versus 9.3\xa0months, p\u2009=\u20090.005). No PPS benefit was observed in PTEN-WT patients receiving TTFields (n\u2009=\u200979, 53%). TTFields therapy conferred a significant PPS benefit in PTEN-mutant rGBM. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underpinning the differences in response to TTFields therapy could help elucidate the mechanism of action of TTFields and identify the rGBM patients most likely to benefit from this therapeutic option.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Tumor treating fields are a new treatment modality available to patients with newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma. Alternating electric fields are delivered via a wearable, removable device affixed to the scalp of patients with supratentorial glioblastoma. With continuous use, the application of tumor treating fields combined with temozolomide chemotherapy has been shown to improve overall survival compared with temozolomide alone in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Adverse events attributable to the device are limited to localized skin reactions. Despite compendium guidelines in support of its use and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, tumor treating fields have been slow to be adopted in the neuro-oncology community. Critics have raised concerns about the generalizability of the study data, patient quality of life, and mechanism of action of this therapy. Tumor treating fields are available for the treatment of both newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma and represent a new category of treatment modalities in oncologic therapy. This novel device has received FDA approval but has been slow to be adopted into clinical practice.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2. Study type and methodology\n3.

TTFields are FDA approved for treatment of newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma. Combining TTFields with immunotherapy is a rational approach due to their different mechanisms of action (MOA) and to the ability of TTFields to induce immunogenic cell death. Conversely, TTFields may interfere with immune functions critical for effective T-cell responses. To evaluate the effects of TTFields on pivotal antitumoral T-cell functions. T-cells from healthy donor peripheral blood (PB) or from viably dissociated human glioblastoma samples were cultured under normal or TTFields conditions, with or without superantigen stimulation. Multiparametric flow cytometry (8-color) was used to assess T-cell responses by monitoring select pivotal functions: proliferation (CFSE), IFNγ secretion, cytotoxic degranulation (CD107a), and activation/exhaustion (PD-1). Cellular viability was assessed in a dedicated assay. A chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell-based assay directly evaluated cellular cytotoxicity. Activated PB T-cells and tumor-infiltrating T-cells (TILs) preserved all monitored anti- tumoral functions under TTFields, apart from proliferation. This finding also applied specifically to PD-1 + TILs, comprised predominantly of tumor antigen-specific cells. Activated T-cells that attempted to proliferate under TTFields demonstrated decreased viability, in line with TTField MOA. Small or no reduction in viability was found in T-cells that did not attempt to proliferate, whether activated or resting. All monitored anti-tumoral T cell functions, except for proliferation, were unhindered by TTFields. Our results support further investigation into combinations of TTFields with T-cell based immunotherapeutic approaches.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

Activated PB T-cells and tumor-infiltrating T-cells (TILs) preserved all monitored anti- tumoral functions under TTFields, apart from proliferation. This finding also applied specifically to PD-1 + TILs, comprised predominantly of tumor antigen-specific cells. Activated T-cells that attempted to proliferate under TTFields demonstrated decreased viability, in line with TTField MOA. Small or no reduction in viability was found in T-cells that did not attempt to proliferate, whether activated or resting. All monitored anti-tumoral T cell functions, except for proliferation, were unhindered by TTFields. Our results support further investigation into combinations of TTFields with T-cell based immunotherapeutic approaches.\n\nProvide a focused summary that:\n1.

Its mechanism of action (MOA) involves selectively disrupting cancer cell division and inhibiting tumor growth.  \n\n**Methodology Overview:**  \nTTFields are applied locally to the tumor site using transducer arrays, targeting actively dividing cells while sparing non-dividing tissues.  \n\n**Population Characteristics:**  \nThe treatment has been validated primarily in newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients and is under investigation for other tumor types.  \n\n**Key Statistical Results:**  \nWhile specific numerical data are not provided in this abstract, prior studies have demonstrated TTFields\' efficacy and safety in glioblastoma management.  \n\n**Clinical Implications:**  \nTTFields offer a non-invasive adjunct to standard glioblastoma treatments, improving patient outcomes without systemic toxicity. Its expanding applications suggest a promising role in broader oncology care.\n\nArticle PMID:31507132\n**Summary:**  \n\n**Main Findings & Conclusions:**  \nOptune, which utilizes Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields), disrupts glioblastoma cell proliferation by impairing mitosis. This study found that while TTFields reduced T-cell proliferation, other key anti-tumoral functions—such as IFNγ secretion, cytotoxic degranulation (CD107a), and activation/exhaustion (PD-1)—remained intact. These findings suggest TTFields could be combined with T-cell-based immunotherapies without significantly impairing immune function.  \n\n**Methodology Overview:**  \nPeripheral blood (PB) T-cells from healthy donors and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) from glioblastoma samples were cultured under TTField or control conditions, with or without superantigen stimulation. Multiparametric flow cytometry (8-color) assessed proliferation (CFSE), IFNγ secretion, cytotoxic degranulation (CD107a), and activation/exhaustion (PD-1). A separate assay evaluated cellular viability, and a CAR T-cell-based assay measured cytotoxicity.  \n\n**Population Characteristics:**  \nT-cells were obtained from healthy donor peripheral blood and viably dissociated glioblastoma tumor samples. PD-1+ TILs, which are primarily tumor antigen-specific, were specifically analyzed.  \n\n**Key Statistical Results:**  \n- Activated T-cells attempting to proliferate under TTFields showed decreased viability.  \n- Non-proliferating T-cells, whether activated or resting, exhibited little to no viability reduction.  \n- All assessed anti-tumoral T-cell functions, except proliferation, remained unaffected.  \n\n**Clinical Implications:**  \nThese findings support the use of TTFields in glioblastoma treatment without significantly impairing T-cell-mediated immune responses. The selective disruption of proliferating cells aligns with TTFields\' MOA, making it a viable adjunct to immunotherapy. Further research is needed to explore combination strategies with T-cell-based treatments.\n\nArticle PMID:31444292\n**Summary:**  \n\n**Main Findings & Conclusions:** Tumor-treating fields (TTFields) are a noninvasive antimitotic therapy that disrupts cancer cell division, inhibits proliferation, interferes with migration and invasion, and reduces DNA repair. Clinical trials in glioblastoma (GBM) patients demonstrated improved overall survival, leading to FDA approval.

This study investigates GaM’s mechanism at the mitochondrial level, focusing on its interaction with iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster-containing proteins.  \n\n**Methodology:**  \nResearchers used an orthotopic rat glioblastoma model and glioblastoma cell cultures. Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was measured using an Extracellular Flux Analyzer, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy assessed gallium’s interaction with Fe-S cluster assembly proteins. The study also evaluated GaM’s effects in combination with metformin.  \n\n**Key Findings:**  \n- GaM (50 μmol/L, 24 h) inhibited glioblastoma cell growth by <10% but reduced OCR by 44% and eliminated mitochondrial reserve capacity.  \n- GaM blocked mitochondrial complex I activity and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels 2.9-fold.  \n- NMR spectroscopy showed gallium binds to IscU, stabilizing its folded state and inhibiting Fe-S cluster assembly.  \n- Metformin enhanced GaM’s inhibition of complex I, further increasing ROS and synergistically enhancing cytotoxicity in glioblastoma cells.  \n\n**Clinical Implications:**  \nGaM exerts its anti-glioblastoma effects by disrupting Fe-S cluster assembly, impairing mitochondrial complex I function, and increasing ROS. Metformin enhances these effects, suggesting a potential combination therapy for glioblastoma.\n\nProvide a comprehensive synthesis that:\n1. Begins with a brief overview\n2.

In 103 newly diagnosed GBM patients, we assessed mutations, copy number variants (CNVs), fusions, and overexpression in 46 genes encoding protein kinases (PKs) potentially targeted by regorafenib or its metabolites and performed a functional enrichment analysis to assess their implications in angiogenesis. We analyzed regorafenib's binding inhibitory activity and target affinity for these 46 PKs and focused on a subset of 18 genes inhibited by regorafenib at clinically achievable concentrations and on 19 genes involved in angiogenesis. Putative oncogenic alterations were defined as oncogenic/likely oncogenic mutations, oncogenic fusions, CNVs > 5, and/or gene overexpression. Regorafenib did not target all 46 PKs. For the 46-gene set, 40 genes (86.9%) and 73 patients (70.8%) harbored at least one alteration in genes encoding targetable PKs, but putative oncogenic alterations were present in only 34 patients (33%). In the 18-gene set, 18 genes (100%) and 48 patients (46.6%) harbored alterations, but putative oncogenic alterations were detected in only 26 patients (25.2%). Thirty patients (29.1%) had oncogenic alterations in the 18-gene set and/or in angiogenesis-related genes. Around 33% of patients had oncogenic alterations in any of the 46 potential targets. Additionally, the suboptimal dosing of regorafenib, due to its poor penetration of the blood-brain barrier, may reduce the likelihood of effectively targeting certain PKs. Future use of multi-target drugs must be guided by a thorough understanding of target presence, effective inhibition, and the drug's ability to reach brain tumors at adequate concentrations.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Conventional methods for assessing MGMT promoter methylation, such as methylation-specific PCR, are invasive and require tissue sampling. <b>Methods</b>: A comprehensive literature search was performed in compliance with the updated PRISMA 2020 guidelines within electronic databases MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, and IEEE Xplore. Search terms, including "MGMT", "methylation", "glioma", "glioblastoma", "machine learning", "deep learning", and "radiomics", were adopted in various MeSH combinations. Original studies in the English, Italian, German, and French languages were considered for inclusion. <b>Results</b>: This review analyzed 34 studies conducted in the last six years, focusing on assessing MGMT methylation status using radiomics (RD), deep learning (DL), or combined approaches. These studies utilized radiological data from the public (e.g., BraTS, TCGA) and private institutional datasets. Sixteen studies focused exclusively on glioblastoma (GBM), while others included low- and high-grade gliomas. Twenty-seven studies reported diagnostic accuracy, with fourteen achieving values above 80%. The combined use of DL and RD generally resulted in higher accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, although some studies reported lower minimum accuracy compared to studies using a single model. <b>Conclusions:</b> The integration of RD and DL offers a powerful, non-invasive tool for precisely recognizing MGMT promoter methylation status in gliomas, paving the way for enhanced personalized medicine in neuro-oncology. The heterogeneity of study populations, data sources, and methodologies reflected the complexity of the pipeline and machine learning algorithms, which may require general standardization to be implemented in clinical practice.\n\nConsider:\n1.

The aim of this study was to discover actionable alterations and to match these with targeted therapies. Between January 2016 and December 2023, 483 brain tumor patients were profiled. We retrieved clinical data and molecular data. Whole exome, whole genome, or panel sequencing, along with SNP array analyses, and RNA-seq were performed on resected primary tumor tissue. Alterations were classified according to the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Scale for Clinical Actionability of Molecular Targets (ESCAT) following the European Association of Neuro-Oncology (EANO) guideline on rational molecular testing. A total of 200 (41.4%) patients' tumors harbored an alteration of interest according to the EANO guideline. Twenty (4.1%) patients had an ESCAT high-tier alteration (tier I or II), while 155 patients (32.1%) had an alteration corresponding to ESCAT IIIA. Thirty-five patients (7.2%) had an actionable alteration, and 15 (3.1%) received targeted therapy. The treated targets were BRAFV600E mutations, FGFR alterations, NTRK fusions, PDGFRA fusions, PTPRZ1-MET fusions, and TMB-high. The overall response rate was 20%, with a median duration of response of 12 months, and 47% achieved stable disease as the best response. Genomic profiling uncovers alterations of interest in a substantial number of patients, but only a minority are considered by the Danish National Molecular Tumor Board to have actionable alterations, and even fewer receive targeted therapy. Nevertheless, factors, such as promising targets and the increasing availability of trials, may contribute to a future increase in the number of patients benefiting from targeted therapies based on genomic profiling.\n\nConsider:\n1.

N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification plays a critical role in the development of brain tumor. WTAP and ZC3H13 have been identified across various species. Immune contexture, which includes the tumor microenvironment (TME), plays a significant role in cancer progression and treatment. This study aimed to explore the potential impact between WTAP and ZC3H13 on the immunological characteristics of GBM. We utilized data from TCGA-GBM, GEO and CGGA datasets to obtain platform and probe data. Patients with GBM were stratified into two clusters based on the expression of WTAP and ZC3H13 using consensus clustering approach. Immune infiltration within the tumor microenvironment was assessed using ESTIMATE, CIBERSORT and ssGSEA methodologies. Functional disparities were determined through gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Tumor mutation burden (TMB) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) were also analyzed. Co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to identify genes associated with WTAP/ZC3H13 and immunity. Validation was performed using GEO and CGGA datasets. Our analysis revealed that cluster1 exhibited higher WTAP expression but lower ZC3H13 expression compared to cluster2. Cluster1 showed higher levels of immune infiltration and TMB compared to cluster2. WGCNA identified 15 genes closely associated with WTAP/ZC3H13 expression and immune scores, notably CTLA4, CD27, ICOS, and LAG3. Our results suggested that WTAP and ZC3H13 influence on immune contexture of GBM, providing new insights into tumor immunity in GBM.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

Here, we assessed the prevalence of MGMT methylation status among GBM patients in the United States. Additionally, we evaluated treatment practices and survival outcomes of GBM patients according to MGMT promoter methylation status. The National Cancer Database was queried to identify all adult U.S. patients (≥\u200918 years) diagnosed with IDH-wildtype GBM between 2018 and 2020. Treatment regimen was grouped into no chemotherapy and no radiotherapy, chemotherapy alone (without radiotherapy), radiotherapy alone (without chemotherapy), and chemoradiotherapy (chemotherapy and radiotherapy). Survival data were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves, log-rank tests, and multivariable Cox proportional hazard modeling. A total of 20,734 patients were included, of whom 6,404 (30.9%) had MGMT-methylated GBM, 9,065 (43.7%) had MGMT-unmethylated tumors, and 5,265 (25.4%) had unknown methylation status. The median and three-year overall survival were 12.4 months and 15.5%, respectively, for the entire cohort (16.4 months and 23.9% for MGMT-methylated patients and 11.8 months and 9.8% for MGMT-unmethylated patients, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Chemoradiotherapy was less commonly used for elderly (≥\u200970 years, 58.5%) than non-elderly (<\u200970 years, 79.2%) patients. Among elderly patients, radiotherapy alone was more commonly administered than chemotherapy alone for patients with MGMT-unmethylated tumors (11.2% vs. 2.1%) and MGMT-methylated tumors (6.6% vs. 3.9%). However, chemotherapy alone was associated with a lower mortality risk (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.51-0.99, p\u2009=\u20090.04) than radiotherapy alone for elderly patients with MGMT-methylated tumors, while chemotherapy alone was associated with a higher mortality risk (HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.09-2.44, p\u2009=\u20090.02) than radiotherapy alone for elderly patients with MGMT-unmethylated tumors. Patients who were elderly, uninsured, insured through Medicaid, lived in zip codes with lower median education levels, or received care at non-academic programs were less likely to undergo MGMT testing. A high proportion of GBM patients in the United States undergo MGMT promoter testing, though significant sociodemographic disparities exist. While there was a decrease in chemoradiotherapy use with increasing age, radiotherapy alone was more commonly administered to elderly patients than chemotherapy alone irrespective of MGMT promoter methylation status.\n\nConsider:\n1.

It may be happened because of drug resistance against their typical receptors, since these receptor genes are often mutated by environmental stress. So identifying mutated oncodriver genes which could be used as potential drug target is essential in order to develop effective new therapeutic drugs as well as better prognosis for GBM patients. In this study, we analyzed whole exome sequencing (WES) profiles of NCBI database on GBM and matched-normal (control) samples originated from astrocyte like neural stem cells (NSC) of subventricular zone (SVZ) to explore GBM-causing mutated oncodriver genes, since SVZ is considered as the origin of GBM development. We detected 16 mutated oncodriver genes. Then, filtering by differential co-expression analysis based on independent RNA-Seq profiles of CGGA database revealed 10 genes as dysregulated oncodriver genes. Following that, 3 significantly overexpressed oncodriver genes (MTCH2, VWF, and WDR89) were identified as potential drug targets. Then molecular mechanisms of GBM development were investigated by these three overexpressed driver genes through gene ontology (GO), KEGG-pathways, Gene regulatory network (GRN) and mutation analysis. Finally, overexpressed oncodriver genes guided top-ranked six drug agents (Irinotecan, Imatinib, etoposide, pazopanib, trametinib and cabozanitinib) were recommended against GBM through molecular docking study. Most of our findings received support by the literature review also. Therefore, the findings of this study might carry potential values to the wet-lab researchers for further investigation in terms of diagnosis and therapies of GBM.\n\nConsider:\n1.

We analyzed the frequency of PD-L1 expression in glioma samples. Methodology In this two-year retrospective study, 45 glioma cases of varying grades (grades 2 to 4) were examined at a tertiary care hospital. Tumor samples that were formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) were obtained from the pathology archives of the hospital. According to the WHO Classification of Central Nervous System Tumors, 5th edition, tumor grading and histopathological subtyping were carried out. PD-L1 antibody (clone 28-8) and IDH1 (R132H, clone QM002, Quartett Immunodiagnostika, 1:100 dilution) markers were used for immunohistochemistry (IHC). The sections underwent deparaffinization, rehydration, and antigen retrieval using Leica bond III staining platform. Based on the tumor proportion score (TPS), which is the proportion of viable tumor cells with membranous staining, PD-L1 expression was assessed. The literature's standardized cut-off values were used to determine positive expression. Staining intensity and tumor cell location were used to determine the status of IDH1 mutations. Age, sex, and tumor location were among the clinical and demographic information gathered about the patient. The association between PD-L1 expression, glioma grades, and IDH1 (R132H) mutation status was assessed statistically using SPSS software and a Chi-square test. The threshold for statistical significance was p < 0.05. For every IHC run, positive and negative controls were used as part of the quality control procedures. To reduce bias and guarantee consistency, two pathologists and post graduate residents independently reviewed the results. Results PD-L1 expression was found in 27 out of 36 (75%) grade 4 glioblastoma multiforme cases and six out of nine (66.7%) grade 2 gliomas. Overall, 33/45 (73.3%) of the gliomas had PD-L1 expression. However, PD-L1 expression and glioma grade did not correlate in a statistically significant way. IDH1 (R132H) expression and PD-L1 were found to be inversely correlated (p < 0.05). Conclusion The findings suggest that PD-L1 may be a promising therapeutic target, even in the absence of significant grade-specific trends by\xa0demonstrating PD-L1 presence in the majority of glioma cases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in GBM immunotherapy. The results provide insight into the immune landscape of gliomas and pave the way for future research into effective combination therapies for GBM, despite the lack of a significant correlation between glioma grade and PD-L1 expression.\n\nConsider:\n1.

This study aims to develop a comprehensive prognostic model to identify biomarkers associated with temozolomide (TMZ) resistance. We employed a multifaceted approach, combining differential expression and univariate Cox regression analyses to screen for TMZ resistance-related differentially expressed genes (TMZR-RDEGs) in GBM. Using LASSO Cox analysis, we selected 12 TMZR-RDEGs to construct a risk score model, which was evaluated for performance through survival analysis, time-dependent ROC, and stratified analyses. Functional enrichment and mutation analyses were conducted to explore the underlying mechanisms of the risk score and its relationship with immune cell infiltration levels in GBM. The prognostic risk score model, based on the 12 TMZR-RDEGs, demonstrated high efficacy in predicting GBM patient outcomes and emerged as an independent predictive factor. Additionally, we focused on the molecule TSPAN13, whose role in GBM is not well understood. We assessed cell proliferation, migration, and invasion capabilities through in vitro assays (including CCK-8, Edu, wound healing, and transwell assays) and quantitatively analyzed TSPAN13 expression levels in clinical glioma samples using tissue microarray immunohistochemistry. The impact of TSPAN13 on TMZ resistance in GBM cells was validated through in vitro experiments and a mouse orthotopic xenograft model. Notably, TSPAN13 was upregulated in GBM and correlated with poorer patient prognosis. Knockdown of TSPAN13 inhibited GBM cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and enhanced sensitivity to TMZ treatment. This study provides a valuable prognostic tool for GBM and identifies TSPAN13 as a critical target for therapeutic intervention.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

This review discusses the application, emerging trends, and challenges associated with using radiomics in glioma. Integrating deep learning algorithms enhances various radiomics components, including image normalization, region of interest segmentation, feature extraction, feature selection, and model construction and can potentially improve model accuracy and performance. Moreover, investigating specific tumor habitats of glioblastomas aids in a better understanding of glioblastoma aggressiveness and the development of effective treatment strategies. Additionally, advanced imaging techniques, such as diffusion-weighted imaging, perfusion-weighted imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, magnetic resonance fingerprinting, functional MRI, and positron emission tomography, can provide supplementary information for tumor characterization and classification. Furthermore, radiomics analysis helps understand the glioma immune microenvironment by predicting immune-related biomarkers and characterizing immune responses within tumors. Integrating multi-omics data, such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and pathomics, with radiomics, aids the understanding of the biological significance of the underlying radiomics features and improves the prediction of genetic mutations, prognosis, and treatment response in patients with glioma. Addressing challenges, such as model reproducibility, model generalizability, model interpretability, and multi-omics data integration, is crucial for the clinical translation of radiomics in glioma.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Here, we characterized 5 murine GBM stem-like cell (mGSC) models derived from lentivirus-induced tumors in transgenic mice that are driven by the activation of the Nf1-Ras signaling pathway and inactivation of Tp53. MGSC lines (005, RIG, NF53, C1, and C3) were cultured as spheres in serum-free stem cell media. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was employed to quantify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Stem cell properties were characterized by stemness in vitro and tumorigenicity after intracerebral implantation in C57BL/6 mice. Tumor phenotypes and the immune microenvironment were characterized by immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and RNA sequencing. WES revealed a large variation in coding sequence SNPs across mGSC lines (~20-fold), likely influenced by the mixed backgrounds of the parental mice. MGSCs exhibited variable clonogenic sphere formation and CD133 expression levels. In vivo, they consistently initiated lethal malignant gliomas, with median survival ranging from 29 to 82 days, and showed strong CD44 expression and variable invasiveness. The tumor microenvironment featured an abundance of CD68+ macrophages and uniform high PD-L1+ myeloid cells, while T-cell infiltration varied among the models, with low mutation burden C1 and C3 exhibiting fewer tumor-infiltrating T cells. Upon orthotopic implantation in immunocompetent mice, mGSCs generate tumors characteristic of human GBM. Despite similar strategies to generate these mGSCs, they exhibited a range of phenotypes and immune profiles in mGSC-derived orthotopic tumors. These mGSCs provide new preclinical GBM models for developing GBM immunotherapies.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2. Study type and methodology\n3. Population characteristics\n4.

Beyond its role in splicing, PRPF4 has been implicated in cell survival, apoptosis, and oncogenesis. Although PRPF4 mutations have been associated with retinitis pigmentosa, its role in glioblastoma (GBM) remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the function of PRPF4 in GBM progression and its potential as a therapeutic target. Gene expression profiling was conducted to compare PRPF4 levels between GBM tumors and normal tissues. PRPF4 expression was also evaluated in various cancer and GBM cell lines. Stable PRPF4 knockdown cell lines were established using A172 and T98G GBM cell lines. Cellular proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion were assessed through gene expression and functional assays. Additionally, molecular pathways affected by PRPF4 knockdown were examined, focusing on the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. Finally, metabolic processes in PRPF4 knockdown cells were estimated through proteomic analysis. PRPF4 expression was elevated in GBM. Knockdown of PRPF4 reduced cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, and suppressed migration and invasion in GBM cells. PRPF4 knockdown also suppressed MKK3/6-p38-ATF2 and RAS-MEK-ERK1/2 signaling pathways. Proteome analysis revealed disruptions in metabolic pathways, including glutathione and carbon metabolisms, which are associated with GBM progression. PRPF4 knockdown inhibits GBM progression by reducing p38 MAPK and ERK signaling cascade with metabolic alterations. Targeting PRPF4 may offer novel therapeutic strategies for GBM treatment.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2. Study type and methodology\n3. Population characteristics\n4.

HNF1B is a critical transcription element in vertebrate proliferation and oncogenesis, which has been shown to play roles in reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism. Our previous results have identified HNF1B as a tumor suppressor that could inhibit the malignant progression of prostate cancer. Yet there is no pan-carcinomatosis analysis of HNF1B, which could help us better understand common and unique underlying mechanisms in mankind knubs to enhance novel and competent treatment. Here, in our research, we evaluated the utterance pattern and explored the function of HNF1B in 33 knub categories using the data from the Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and CLNICAL PROTEOMICTUMOR ANALYSIS CONSORTIUM (CPTAC) dataset. We found different HNF1B roles in various cancer types. HNF1B was upregulated in CHOL, STAD, KIRP, and THCA, and was downregulated in GBM, KICH, COAD, KIRC, LUSC, SARC, PAAD, and TGCT. Prognostic analyses indicated that higher HNF1B displayed better illness outcomes in BLCA, READ, and PRAD, while poorer outcomes in LUSC and THYM. HNF1B mutation was most frequent in endometrial cancer but was not associated with disease prognosis. It was discovered that HNF1B utterance relevant to endothelial cell penetration status in BLCA, ESCA, LUAD, LUSC, and TGCT, and carcinomatosis-associated fibroblast infiltration was observed in ESCA, KIRC, LIHC, and TGCT. Moreover, functional enrichment analysis disclosed that metabolism-related functions were implicated in the function of HNF1B. Taken together, our pan- carcinomatosis analysis showed the complicated roles of HNF1B in a variety of carcinomatoses, being able to improve the extensive comprehension of HNF1B's role in tumorigenesis.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Alterations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number (CN) serve a crucial role in GBM development and progression, affecting various aspects of tumor biology, including energy production, oxidative stress regulation and cellular adaptability. Fluctuations in mtDNA levels, whether elevated or diminished, can impair mitochondrial function, potentially disrupting oxidative phosphorylation and amplifying reactive oxygen species generation, thereby fueling tumor growth and influencing treatment responses. Understanding the mechanisms of mtDNA‑CN variations, and their interplay with genetic and environmental elements in the tumor microenvironment, is essential for advancing diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Targeting mtDNA alterations could strengthen treatment efficacy, mitigate resistance and ultimately enhance the prognosis of patients with this aggressive brain tumor. The present review summarizes the existing literature on mtDNA alterations, specifically emphasizing variations in mtDNA‑CN and their association with GBM by surveying articles published between 1996 and 2024, sourced from databases such as Scopus, PubMed and Google Scholar. In addition, the review provides a brief overview of mitochondrial genome architecture, knowledge regarding the regulation of mtDNA integrity and CN, and how mitochondria significantly impact GBM tumorigenesis. This review further presents information on therapeutic approaches for restoring mtDNA‑CN that contribute to optimized mitochondrial function and improved health outcomes.\n\nConsider:\n1.

We employed a combination of genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), and scPagwas (pathway-based polygenic regression framework) methods to explore the genetic links between UDIPs and GBM. Two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses were conducted to identify causal relationships between UDIPs and GBM. Colocalization analysis was performed to validate genetic associations, while scPagwas analysis was used to evaluate the relevance of key UDIPs to GBM at the cellular level. Among 512 UDIPs tested, 23 were found to have significant causal associations with GBM. Notably, UDIPs such as T1-33 (OR\u2009=\u20091.007, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.001 to 1.012, P\u2009=\u2009.022), T1-34 (OR\u2009=\u20091.012, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.001-1.023, P\u2009=\u2009.028), and T1-96 (OR\u2009=\u20091.009, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.001-1.019, P\u2009=\u2009.046) were found to have a genetic association with GBM. Furthermore, T1-34 and T1-96 were significantly associated with GBM recurrence, with P-values < .0001 and P\u2009<\u2009.001, respectively. In addition, scPagwas analysis revealed that T1-33, T1-34, and T1-96 are distinctively linked to different GBM subtypes, with T1-33 showing strong associations with the neural progenitor-like subtype (NPC2), T1-34 with mesenchymal (MES2) and neural progenitor (NPC1) cells, and T1-96 with the NPC2 subtype. T1-33, T1-34, and T1-96 hold significant potential for predicting tumor recurrence and aiding in the development of personalized GBM treatment strategies.\n\nConsider:\n1.

However, no c-Met kinase inhibitors are currently approved specifically for the treatment of c-Met-amplified gastric cancer. Recently, bozitinib, a highly selective c-Met kinase inhibitor, has shown remarkable potency in selectively inhibiting MET-altered non-small cell lung cancer and secondary glioblastoma. In this study, we investigate the antitumor activity of bozitinib against MET-amplified gastric cancer and elucidate its molecular mechanism. Bozitinib demonstrates a strong effect on MET-amplified gastric cancer cells by blocking the c-Met signaling pathway, leading to the inhibition of cell proliferation and survival, as well as the induction of G0/G1 phase arrest and apoptosis. Structurally, bozitinib is optimally embedded in the ATP pocket of c-Met and firmly binds via an extensive interaction network. In addition, bozitinib efficiently inhibits c-Met resistance-conferring mutations G1163R and Y1230H, although its potency is significantly decreased against the D1228N and Y1230C mutations. Overall, our study reveals the molecular mechanism of bozitinib against c-Met, highlights its ability to overcome acquired resistance mutations, and provides valuable insights into further design and improvement of selective c-Met inhibitors.\n\nConsider:\n1.

The survival rate remains low despite standard therapies, highlighting the urgent need for novel treatment strategies. Advanced imaging techniques, particularly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are crucial in assessing GBM. Disruptions in various oncogenic signaling pathways, such as Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK)-Ras-Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling, Phosphoinositide 3- Kinases (PI3Ks), tumor protein p53 (TP53), and Neurogenic locus notch homolog protein (NOTCH), contribute to the development of different tumor types, each exhibiting distinct morphological and phenotypic features that can be observed at a microscopic level. However, identifying genetic abnormalities for targeted therapy often requires invasive procedures, prompting exploration into non-invasive approaches like radiogenomics. This study explores the utility of radiogenomics and machine learning (ML) in predicting these oncogenic signaling pathways in GBM patients. We collected post-operative MRI scans (T1w, T1c, FLAIR, T2w) from the BRATS-19 dataset, including scans from patients with both GBM and LGG, linked to genetic and clinical data via TCGA and CPTAC. Signaling pathway data was manually extracted from cBioPortal. Radiomic features were extracted from four MRI modalities using PyRadiomics. Dimensionality reduction and feature selection were applied and Data imbalance was addressed with SMOTE. Five ML models were trained to predict signaling pathways, with Grid Search optimizing hyperparameters and 5-fold cross-validation ensuring unbiased performance. Each model's performance was evaluated using various metrics on test data. Our results showed a positive association between most signaling pathways and the radiomic features derived from MRI scans. The best models achieved high AUC scores, namely 0.7 for RTK-RAS, 0.8 for PI3K, 0.75 for TP53, and 0.4 for NOTCH, and therefore, demonstrated the potential of ML models in accurately predicting oncogenic signaling pathways from radiomic features, thereby informing personalized therapeutic approaches and improving patient outcomes. We present a novel approach for the non-invasive prediction of deregulation in oncogenic signaling pathways in glioblastoma (GBM) by integrating radiogenomic data with machine learning models. This research contributes to advancing precision medicine in GBM management, highlighting the importance of integrating radiomics with genomic data to understand tumor behavior and treatment response better.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Non-canonical mutations such as BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>, found in 1-2% of GBMs, activate the MEK-ERK signaling pathway. This mutation can be targeted by small molecule inhibitors, offering therapeutic potential for GBM. In this case report, we describe the management of a 67-year-old male with BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> -mutant GBM, who experienced both local clonal and distant non-clonal BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> -mutant recurrences. Initial treatment involved surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and temozolomide (TMZ). Subsequent recurrences were managed with re-resection and dabrafenib/trametinib combination therapy. Notably, a new, non-clonal BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> -negative tumor developed in a distant location, highlighting the challenge of clonal evolution and resistance in GBM management. The patient's disease ultimately progressed despite multiple lines of therapy, including targeted inhibition. Identifying mechanisms of resistance and tailoring flexible treatment approaches are essential for advancing outcomes in BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> -mutant GBM. This case emphasizes the value of molecular profiling in personalizing treatment for patients with multifocal disease. The evolving nature of these tumors requires persistent clinical monitoring and treatment adjustments based on tissue diagnostics.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

We focused on multi-habitat deep image descriptors as our basic focus. A subset of the BRATS 2021 MGMT methylation dataset containing both MGMT class labels and segmentation masks was used. A comprehensive mask fusion approach was developed to select relevant image crops of diseased tissue. These fusion masks, which were guided by multiple sequences, helped collect information from the regions that seem disease-free to radiologists in standard MRI sequences while harboring pathology. Integrating the information in different MRI sequences and leveraging the high entropic capacity of deep neural networks, we built a 3D ROI-based custom CNN classifier for the automatic prediction of MGMT methylation status of glioblastoma in multi-parametric MRI. Single sequence-based classifiers reached intermediate predictive performance with 0.65, 0.71, 0.77, and 0.82 accuracy for T1W, T2W, T1 contrast-enhanced, and FLAIR sequences, respectively. The multiparametric classifier using T1 contrast-enhanced and FLAIR images reached 0.88 accuracy. The accuracy of the four-input model that used all sequences was 0.81. The best model reached 0.90 ROC AUC value. Integrating human knowledge in the form of relevant target selection was a useful approach in MGMT methylation status prediction in MRI. Exploration of means to integrate radiology knowledge into the models and achieve human-machine collaboration may help to develop better models. MGMT methylation status of glioblastoma is an important prognostic marker and is also important for treatment decisions. The preoperative non-invasive predictive ability and the explanation tools of the developed model may help clinicians to better understand imaging phenotypes of MGMT methylation status of glial tumors.\n\nConsider:\n1.

In the following 20 years, it has lived up to expectations. A substantial body of evidence has demonstrated that it is closely related to the development, metastasis, migration, and drug resistance of malignant tumors. In recent years, research on the MSI protein has advanced, and many novel viewpoints and drug resistance attempts have been derived; for example, tumor protein p53 mutations and MSI-binding proteins lead to resistance to protein arginine N-methyltransferase 5-targeted therapy in lymphoma patients. Moreover, the high expression of MSI2 in pancreatic cancer might suppress its development and progression. As a significant member of the MSI family, MSI2 is closely associated with multiple malignant tumors, including hematological disorders, common abdominal tumors, and other tumor types (e.g., glioblastoma, breast cancer). MSI2 is highly expressed in the majority of tumors and is related to a poor disease prognosis. However, its specific expression levels and regulatory mechanisms may differ based on the tumor type. This review summarizes the research progress related to MSI2 in recent years, including its occurrence, migration mechanism, and drug resistance, as well as the prospect of developing tumor immunosuppressants and biomarkers.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Key metabolic pathways, including glycolysis, lactate production, and lipid metabolism, are upregulated to sustain tumor survival in the hypoxic and nutrient-deprived tumor microenvironment (TME), while glutamine and tryptophan metabolism further contribute to the aggressive phenotype of GBM. These metabolic alterations impair immune cell function, leading to exhaustion and stress in CD8+ and CD4+ T cells while favoring immunosuppressive populations such as regulatory T cells (Tregs) and M2-like macrophages. Recent studies emphasize the role of slow-cycling GBM cells (SCCs), lipid-laden macrophages, and tumor-associated astrocytes (TAAs) in reshaping GBM's metabolic landscape and reinforcing immune evasion. Genetic mutations, including <i>Isocitrate Dehydrogenase</i> (<i>IDH</i>) mutations, <i>Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor</i> (<i>EGFR</i>) amplification, and <i>Phosphotase and Tensin Homolog</i> (<i>PTEN</i>) loss, further drive metabolic reprogramming and offer potential targets for therapy. Understanding the relationship between GBM metabolism and immune suppression is critical for overcoming therapeutic resistance. This review focuses on the role of metabolic rewiring in GBM, its impact on the immune microenvironment, and the potential of combining metabolic targeting with immunotherapy to improve clinical outcomes for GBM patients.\n\nConsider:\n1.

This study identified detectable oncogene fusions in glioma patients through an integrated analysis of genomic and transcriptomic data, which encompassed whole exon sequencing and next-generation RNA sequencing. In addition, this study also conducted a comparison of the genetic characteristics, tumor microenvironment, mutation burden and survival between glioma patients with or without gene fusions. A total of 68 glioma patients were enrolled in this study, including glioblastoma (GBM), low grade glioma (LGG) and diffuse midline glioma (DMG). 14 cases of GBM patients (51.9%, 14/27) were found to harbor the following 70 oncogenic gene fusions: ROS1 (n\u2009=\u20098), NTRK (n\u2009=\u20095), KIF5 (n\u2009=\u20095), RET (n\u2009=\u20093) and other infrequent gene fusions (n\u2009=\u200949). A total of 11 gene fusions were identified in 8 LGG patients (32.0%, 8/25) and seven gene fusions were identified in one DMG patient (16.7%, 1/6). In GBM patient group, five genes including HOXA3, ACTB, CDK5, GNA12 and CARD11 exhibited a statistically significant higher copy number amplification frequency in the GBM group without gene fusions compared to that in the GBM group with gene fusions. In LGG patient group, CDK5 gene was also found to exhibit a statistically significant higher amplification frequency in the LGG group without gene fusions. In addition, KMT2D exhibited a statistically significant higher mutation frequency in the LGG group with gene fusions compared to that in the LGG group without gene fusions. Comparison of the other genetic characteristics including immune cell infiltration score, tumor mutation burden (TMB), and microsatellite instability (MSI). The results showed no statistically significant differences were observed between fusion and non-fusion group of GBM and LGG. The survival analysis revealed that GBM patients without gene fusions exhibited a longer median survival (737\xa0days) compared to GBM patients with gene fusions (642\xa0days), but without a statistical significancy. Our study has identified a set of gene fusions present in gliomas, including a number of novel gene fusions that have not been previously reported. We have also elucidated the underlying genetic characteristics of glioma with gene fusions. Collectively, our findings have the potential to inform future clinical treatment strategies for patients with glioma.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

Gol1 demonstrated **anti-proliferative activity** in patient-derived GB cell cultures and significantly altered gene transcription, promoting **neurogenesis and differentiation** while suppressing pro-oncogenic pathways. These findings suggest that Gol1 could be a promising candidate for **targeted therapy** in EGFR-mutant GB.  \n\n#### **Methodology Overview:**  \nResearchers designed Gol1 as a **more stable derivative** of the previously studied aptamer U2, using **molecular dynamics simulations** to optimize its secondary structure. The effects of Gol1 were tested on **two patient-derived GB cell cultures (G01 and BU881)** with varying levels of **EGFR and EGFRvIII expression**. Transcriptomic analysis of Gol1-treated G01 cells identified significant changes in gene expression related to tumor growth and differentiation.  \n\n#### **Population Characteristics:**  \nThe study utilized **two patient-derived GB cell cultures**, G01 and BU881, which exhibited different levels of **EGFR and EGFRvIII expression**. Specific patient demographics (e.g., age, sex) were not provided, but the focus was on **EGFR-driven GB subtypes**.  \n\n#### **Key Statistical Results:**  \n- Gol1 treatment induced **significant transcriptional changes** in genes linked to **neurogenesis and differentiation**.  \n- Downregulation of **key nuclear processes** and **pro-oncogenic EGFR-mediated pathways** was observed.  \n- Specific numerical values for gene expression changes were not provided in the abstract.  \n\n#### **Clinical Implications:**  \nThe study supports the development of **Gol1 as a targeted therapy for EGFR-mutant GB**, particularly in tumors expressing **EGFRvIII**, which is associated with **poor prognosis and tumor aggressiveness**. If validated in further **preclinical and clinical studies**, Gol1 could complement or enhance existing **targeted therapies and immunotherapies**, potentially improving outcomes in **EGFR-driven GBM**.\n\nArticle PMID:39940647\nThis study explores a novel targeted therapy for glioblastoma (GBM) by developing an anti-EGFRvIII variable new antigen receptor (vNAR) from a freshwater stingray library, termed vNAR R426. **Main findings** indicate that vNAR R426 effectively binds EGFRvIII, enhances cisplatin (CDDP) delivery, and improves cytotoxicity in GBM cells. **Methodology** included molecular docking, molecular dynamics, immunofluorescence staining, and in vitro testing on the U87-MG glioma cell line. The **population characteristics** are limited to in vitro GBM models. **Key statistical results** showed that cisplatin-conjugated vNAR R426 significantly outperformed free CDDP in cytotoxicity assays at 72 hours (p < 0.05). Mechanistically, vNAR R426 facilitated receptor-mediated endocytosis and COPI-mediated nuclear translocation, enhancing drug delivery. **Clinical implications** suggest that vNAR R426 may improve the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents in EGFRvIII-positive GBM, supporting further investigation into targeted drug delivery strategies.\n\nArticle PMID:39919036\n### Focused Summary  \n\n#### **Main Findings and Conclusions**  \nThis study demonstrates that GBM mutations and differentiation states significantly influence treatment responses. Key findings include:  \n- **TP53 status** affects transcriptional responses to radiation (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ), with wild-type (wt) p53 GBM cells showing treatment-modulated responses.  \n- **MGMT protein levels**, rather than promoter methylation status alone, correlate with TMZ resistance, with NF-κB activation playing a role in MGMT-mediated resistance.  \n- **Differentiation of GBM cancer stem cells (CSCs)** increases resistance to TMZ but not RT, involving BMP-Smad signaling and extracellular matrix remodeling.  \n- **Interferon (IFN) response activation** occurs in both mutant and wt p53 models post-treatment, implicating this pathway in GBM therapy resistance.  \n\n#### **Methodology Overview**  \nThe study used **multi-omics profiling** (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and DNA methylation) on **patient-derived GBM CSCs** to assess responses to astrocytic differentiation, RT, and TMZ.  \n\n#### **Population Characteristics**  \n- **Patient-derived GBM CSCs** were used, representing diverse molecular subtypes.  \n- Models included both **wild-type and mutant TP53** GBM cells.  \n\n#### **Key Statistical Results**  \n- **NF-κB activation** showed a **positive correlation with MGMT protein levels** (p < 0.05), independent of promoter methylation.  \n- **Differentiated CSCs exhibited increased TMZ resistance** (fold change not specified) but retained RT sensitivity.  \n- **IFN response activation** was significant in both **mutant and wt TP53 models** post-treatment (p < 0.01).  \n\n#### **Clinical Implications**  \n- **MGMT protein levels and NF-κB signaling** may be better predictors of TMZ resistance than MGMT promoter methylation alone, suggesting potential benefit from **NF-κB inhibitors**.  \n- **TP53 status influences treatment responses**, which could guide personalized therapy strategies.  \n- **IFN pathway activation** may serve as a therapeutic target in GBM.  \n- Findings support **targeting differentiation-related pathways** to overcome TMZ resistance.  \n\nThis study provides a mechanistic basis for refining **targeted therapies and combination treatments** in GBM.\n\nArticle PMID:39906459\nThis study investigated the relationship between PD-L1 expression, glioma grades, and IDH1 mutations to assess their relevance for GBM immunotherapy. A retrospective analysis of 45 glioma cases (grades 2–4) was conducted using immunohistochemistry on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor samples. PD-L1 expression was assessed using tumor proportion scores, and IDH1 (R132H) mutation status was determined.\n\nKey findings:\n- PD-L1 expression was observed in **73.3% (33/45)** of gliomas, including **75% (27/36) of GBM (grade 4)** and **66.7% (6/9) of grade 2 gliomas**.\n- No statistically significant correlation was found between PD-L1 expression and glioma grade.\n- An **inverse correlation** between PD-L1 expression and **IDH1 (R132H) mutation** was statistically significant (**p < 0.05**).\n\nClinical implications:\n- The high prevalence of PD-L1 expression in GBM suggests its potential as a **therapeutic target for immunotherapy**, regardless of tumor grade.\n- The inverse correlation with IDH1 mutations suggests that **IDH1-wildtype tumors may be more responsive to PD-L1-targeted therapies**.\n- These findings support further research into **combination immunotherapies** for GBM, particularly in IDH1-wildtype cases.\n\nThis study provides insight into the immune landscape of gliomas, reinforcing the potential role of PD-L1 inhibitors in GBM treatment strategies.\n\nArticle PMID:39864140\nThis study investigated the relationship between **IDH1 mutations** and the expression of **immune checkpoint proteins PDCD1 and CD274** in **glioblastoma (GBM)**, assessing their potential impact on immunotherapy.  \n\n### **Main Findings & Conclusions:**  \n- **IDH1 mutations (IDH1<sup>Mu</sup>)** were present in **5.4%** of GBM cases and correlated with **improved overall survival (OS)** (p = **2.196e-3**).  \n- **PDCD1 and CD274** were **highly expressed** in both **IDH1<sup>Mu</sup> and IDH1<sup>Wt</sup>** tumors (p < **0.0001**), with **higher expression linked to worse survival** (PDCD1: p = **0.009**; CD274: p = **0.02**).  \n- Distinct gene and **miRNA expression patterns** were observed between **IDH1<sup>Mu</sup> and IDH1<sup>Wt</sup>** GBMs:  \n  - **IDH1<sup>Wt</sup>**: Upregulation of **PTEN**, downregulation of **MUC16**.  \n  - **IDH1<sup>Mu</sup>**: Upregulation of **PIK3R1**, a potential **therapeutic target**.  \n- **PIK3R1 and ITGB2** were identified as **druggable targets**, suggesting that **IDH1<sup>Mu</sup> GBM may benefit from a combination of PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors and immunotherapy**.  \n\n### **Methodology Overview:**  \n- **Two independent NGS datasets** from TCGA (**n = 577, n = 153**) were analyzed.  \n- **Mutation analysis** via **cBioPortal**, **RNA sequencing** for gene expression, and **miRNA differential expression** via **miRDB and miRabel**.  \n- **Kaplan-Meier survival analysis** assessed prognostic implications.  \n\n### **Population Characteristics:**  \n- **Glioblastoma patients (n = 730 total)** from TCGA datasets.  \n- **IDH1 mutation prevalence ranged from 4% to 31%** across different cohorts.  \n\n### **Key Statistical Results\n\nProvide a comprehensive synthesis that:\n1.

High levels of EGFR expression and mutations have been found in many GB patients, making the EGFR an attractive target for therapeutic treatment. The EGFRvIII mutant is the most studied, it is not found in normal cells and is positively associated with tumor cell aggressiveness and poor patient prognosis, not to mention there is a possibility of it being a tumor stem cell marker. Some anti-EGFR DNA aptamers have already been selected, including the aptamer U2. The goal of this study was to construct a more stable derivative of the aptamer U2, while not ruining its functional potential toward cell cultures from GB patients. A multiloop motif in a putative secondary structure of the aptamer U2 was taken as a key feature to design a novel minimal aptamer, Gol1, using molecular dynamics simulations for predicted 3D models. It turned out that the aptamer Gol1 has a similar putative secondary structure, with G-C base pairs providing its stability. The anti-proliferative activities of the aptamer Gol1 were assessed using patient-derived GB continuous cell cultures, G01 and BU881, with different abundances of EGFR and EGFRvIII. The transcriptome data for the cell culture G01, after aptamer Gol1 treatment, revealed significant changes in gene expression; it induced the transcription of genes associated with neurogenesis and cell differentiation, and it decreased the transcription of genes mediating key nuclear processes. There were significant changes in the gene transcription of key pro-oncogenic signaling pathways mediated by the EGFR. Therefore, the aptamer Gol1 could potentially be an efficient molecule for translation into biomedicine, in order to develop targeted therapy for GB patients.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Some anti-EGFR DNA aptamers have already been selected, including the aptamer U2. The goal of this study was to construct a more stable derivative of the aptamer U2, while not ruining its functional potential toward cell cultures from GB patients. A multiloop motif in a putative secondary structure of the aptamer U2 was taken as a key feature to design a novel minimal aptamer, Gol1, using molecular dynamics simulations for predicted 3D models. It turned out that the aptamer Gol1 has a similar putative secondary structure, with G-C base pairs providing its stability. The anti-proliferative activities of the aptamer Gol1 were assessed using patient-derived GB continuous cell cultures, G01 and BU881, with different abundances of EGFR and EGFRvIII. The transcriptome data for the cell culture G01, after aptamer Gol1 treatment, revealed significant changes in gene expression; it induced the transcription of genes associated with neurogenesis and cell differentiation, and it decreased the transcription of genes mediating key nuclear processes. There were significant changes in the gene transcription of key pro-oncogenic signaling pathways mediated by the EGFR. Therefore, the aptamer Gol1 could potentially be an efficient molecule for translation into biomedicine, in order to develop targeted therapy for GB patients.\n\nProvide a focused summary that:\n1.

We analyzed the frequency of PD-L1 expression in glioma samples. Methodology In this two-year retrospective study, 45 glioma cases of varying grades (grades 2 to 4) were examined at a tertiary care hospital. Tumor samples that were formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) were obtained from the pathology archives of the hospital. According to the WHO Classification of Central Nervous System Tumors, 5th edition, tumor grading and histopathological subtyping were carried out. PD-L1 antibody (clone 28-8) and IDH1 (R132H, clone QM002, Quartett Immunodiagnostika, 1:100 dilution) markers were used for immunohistochemistry (IHC). The sections underwent deparaffinization, rehydration, and antigen retrieval using Leica bond III staining platform. Based on the tumor proportion score (TPS), which is the proportion of viable tumor cells with membranous staining, PD-L1 expression was assessed. The literature's standardized cut-off values were used to determine positive expression. Staining intensity and tumor cell location were used to determine the status of IDH1 mutations. Age, sex, and tumor location were among the clinical and demographic information gathered about the patient. The association between PD-L1 expression, glioma grades, and IDH1 (R132H) mutation status was assessed statistically using SPSS software and a Chi-square test.

To reduce bias and guarantee consistency, two pathologists and post graduate residents independently reviewed the results. Results PD-L1 expression was found in 27 out of 36 (75%) grade 4 glioblastoma multiforme cases and six out of nine (66.7%) grade 2 gliomas. Overall, 33/45 (73.3%) of the gliomas had PD-L1 expression. However, PD-L1 expression and glioma grade did not correlate in a statistically significant way. IDH1 (R132H) expression and PD-L1 were found to be inversely correlated (p < 0.05).

Non-canonical mutations such as BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>, found in 1-2% of GBMs, activate the MEK-ERK signaling pathway. This mutation can be targeted by small molecule inhibitors, offering therapeutic potential for GBM. In this case report, we describe the management of a 67-year-old male with BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> -mutant GBM, who experienced both local clonal and distant non-clonal BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> -mutant recurrences. Initial treatment involved surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and temozolomide (TMZ). Subsequent recurrences were managed with re-resection and dabrafenib/trametinib combination therapy. Notably, a new, non-clonal BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> -negative tumor developed in a distant location, highlighting the challenge of clonal evolution and resistance in GBM management. The patient's disease ultimately progressed despite multiple lines of therapy, including targeted inhibition. Identifying mechanisms of resistance and tailoring flexible treatment approaches are essential for advancing outcomes in BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> -mutant GBM. This case emphasizes the value of molecular profiling in personalizing treatment for patients with multifocal disease. The evolving nature of these tumors requires persistent clinical monitoring and treatment adjustments based on tissue diagnostics.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

In the following 20 years, it has lived up to expectations. A substantial body of evidence has demonstrated that it is closely related to the development, metastasis, migration, and drug resistance of malignant tumors. In recent years, research on the MSI protein has advanced, and many novel viewpoints and drug resistance attempts have been derived; for example, tumor protein p53 mutations and MSI-binding proteins lead to resistance to protein arginine N-methyltransferase 5-targeted therapy in lymphoma patients. Moreover, the high expression of MSI2 in pancreatic cancer might suppress its development and progression. As a significant member of the MSI family, MSI2 is closely associated with multiple malignant tumors, including hematological disorders, common abdominal tumors, and other tumor types (e.g., glioblastoma, breast cancer). MSI2 is highly expressed in the majority of tumors and is related to a poor disease prognosis. However, its specific expression levels and regulatory mechanisms may differ based on the tumor type. This review summarizes the research progress related to MSI2 in recent years, including its occurrence, migration mechanism, and drug resistance, as well as the prospect of developing tumor immunosuppressants and biomarkers.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Disruption of the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway in tumor cells enhances the effectiveness of radiotherapy drugs, while increased mutational burden following tumor cell damage also facilitates the efficacy of immunotherapy. The ATRX gene, located on chromosome X, plays a crucial role in DDR. The aim of this research is to elucidate the correlation between ATRX mutations and GBM. Dataset obtained from TCGA-GBM were conducted an analysis on the genomic features, biological characteristics, immunopathological markers, and clinical prognosis of patients carrying ATRX mutations. Our findings revealed a significantly elevated level of microsatellite instability in individuals with ATRX mutants, along with significant alterations in the receptor-tyrosine kinase (RTK)-ras pathway among patients exhibiting combined ATRX mutations. TCGA-GBM patients with concurrent ATRX mutations exhibited sensitivity to 26 chemotherapeutic and anticancer drugs, which exerted their effects by modulating the DDR of tumor cells through highly correlated mechanisms involving the RTK-ras pathway. Additionally, we observed an enrichment of ATRX mutations in specific pathways associated with DDR among TCGA-GBM patients. Our model also demonstrated prolonged overall survival in patients carrying ATRX mutations, particularly showing strong predictive value for 3- and 5-year survival rates. Furthermore, additional protective factors such as younger age, female gender, combined IDH mutations, and TP53 mutations were identified. The results underscore the protective role and prognostic significance of ATRX mutations in GBM as a potential therapeutic target and biomarker for patient survival.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Aberrant expression of RNF7 has been observed in various tumor types and is known to significantly influence tumor initiation and progression. However, the specific role of RNF7 in glioblastoma remains unclear. IDH (isocitrate dehydrogenase) mutations, which induce metabolic reprogramming and result in notable heterogeneity among glioma with different IDH genotypes. Through analysis of public glioma databases, we identified a high expression of RNF7 in glioma and its correlation with patient prognosis. Moreover, we observed variations in RNF7 expression and its association with patient outcomes under different treatment modalities among different IDH genotypes. In this study, we demonstrated the critical role of RNF7 in the malignant phenotype of IDH1-mutant glioma and its contribution to radiation resistance. Subsequent functional enrichment analysis of RNF7 in glioma, coupled with validation through cellular experiments, confirmed its significant involvement in maintaining redox balance. Our findings suggest that RNF7 exerts a buffering effect against radiation-induced oxidative stress and counterbalances the redox stress induced by IDH1 mutation through its anti-ROS activity. Additionally, our follow-up investigations revealed that the upregulation of RNF7 after radiation exposure and in IDH1-mutant glioma cells is induced by ROS. Collectively, our study underscores the potential of RNF7 as a molecular biomarker in glioma. Elevated RNF7 expression often indicates a heightened metabolic resilience in glioma, leading to resistance against radiotherapy.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

The heterogeneity of GBM complicates diagnosis and treatment, driving research into molecular biomarkers that can offer insights into tumor behavior and guide personalized therapies. This review explores recent advances in molecular biomarkers, highlighting their potential to improve diagnosis and treatment outcomes in GBM patients. Key biomarkers such as MGMT promoter methylation, IDH1/2 mutations, EGFR amplification, and TERT promoter mutations, etc., are examined for their roles in prognosis, therapeutic response, and tumor classification. While molecular biomarkers offer valuable insights for tailoring GBM treatments, their clinical application is hindered by tumor heterogeneity, dynamic genetic evolution, and the lack of standardized testing methods. Future research should aim to confirm new biomarkers and incorporate them into regular clinical practice to improve prognosis and treatment choices. Advances in genomic and proteomic technologies, along with consistent biomarker detection, could transform GBM care and enhance patient outcomes.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

To explore the relationship between MRI perfusion metrics (rCBV, rCBF), genetic markers, and contrast enhancement patterns in gliomas, aiming to enhance diagnostic accuracy and inform personalized therapeutic strategies. Additionally, other radiological features, such as the T2/FLAIR mismatch sign, are evaluated for their predictive utility in IDH mutations. Retrospective cohort study. 67 patients with brain tumors (including glioblastoma, astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma) undergoing surgical resection. 1.5 Tesla MRI, including T1 pre- and post-contrast, FLAIR, DWI, and DSC sequences. Semiquantitative perfusion metrics (rCBV, rCBF) were evaluated against genetic markers (IDH1, EGFR, CDKN2A, PDGFRA, MGMT, TERT, 1p19q, PTEN, TP53, H3F3A) through advanced MRI techniques. Contrast enhancement was assessed, and genetic alterations were confirmed via histopathological and molecular analyses. Chi-square test, sensitivity, specificity, and ROC analysis for predictive modeling; significance level set at p\xa0<\xa00.05. Statistically significant differences in perfusion metrics were observed among tumors with distinct genetic profiles, with primary tumors and those harboring specific mutations (IDH1 wildtype, EGFR amplification, CDKN2A homozygous deletion, PDGFRA amplification) showing higher perfusion values. A cut-off value of <4 for rCBV in predicting IDH1 mutation yielded a sensitivity of 61.5\xa0% and specificity of 82.1\xa0%. For CDKN2A deletion, a cut-off of >5 resulted in a sensitivity of 75\xa0% and specificity of 74.6\xa0%, with an ROC value of 0.78. Integrating perfusion MRI with genetic analysis offers a promising approach to improving the diagnostic and therapeutic landscape for brain tumors, indicating a substantial step toward personalized neuro-oncology. Additionally, findings like the T2/FLAIR mismatch sign highlight the potential for preoperative molecular predictions when biopsy is not feasible. These findings support further validation in larger, multi-institutional studies to solidify their role in clinical practice.

Personalized treatment based on molecular markers may help improve the prognosis. We aimed to evaluate whether apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) histogram analysis can better predict MGMT and TERT molecular characteristics and to determine the prognostic relevance of genetic profile in patients with GBM. MRI, clinical, and pathological data of 79 patients with GBM were retrospectively collected. The ADC values based on histogram analysis were described using 10th percentile (p10), 90th percentile (p90), mean, median, minimum, maximum, skewness, kurtosis, and entropy. The independent-sample t test, linear correlation analysis, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and Cox proportional hazard regression were performed. MGMT promoter methylation and TERT promoter mutation were detected in 53.2% and 44.3% of GBM patients, respectively. The ADC<sub>p10</sub> in MGMT promoter unmethylated group was significantly lower than that in the MGMT promoter methylated group (p\xa0=\xa00.005). There were significant differences in ADC<sub>min</sub>, ADC<sub>p10</sub>, ADC<sub>mean</sub>, and entropy between TERT promoter mutant and wild-type groups. Entropy showed the best diagnostic performance in differentiating between positive and negative TERT groups (AUC\xa0=\xa00.722, p\xa0=\xa00.001). Overall survival (OS) showed a positive correlation with ADC<sub>min</sub>. The TERT promoter mutation was the only independent prognostic factor for GBM. ADC histogram analysis may be a potential noninvasive biomarker for differentiating MGMT and TERT molecular markers and providing prognostic information for GBM patients.\n\nConsider:\n1.

The molecular profile of adult PLG has not been well-characterized. We report the clinical, pathological, and molecular findings of six adult PLG patients (five males and one female), median age 58\u2009years. All cases exhibited pathological leptomeningeal enhancement at presentation. Leptomeningeal biopsy was diagnostic in five (of six) cases, revealing infiltration by an astrocytic glioma with mitotic activity, lacking microvascular proliferation or necrosis. One case was diagnosed at autopsy. All tumors were IDH-wildtype, with five harboring TERT promoter mutations. Additional mutations identified were PTEN in one case, TP53 in two cases, and NF1 in two cases. A chromosome profile with +7/-10 was found in four cases, whereas the remaining two showed either chromosome 7 or 7p gain only. Four cases showed chromosome 9p loss with CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion, one case showed hemizygous CDKN2A/B loss, and one case showed intact chromosome 9 and CDK4/GLI1 amplification. DNA methylation profiling was performed in four cases and revealed a match to glioblastoma (GBM) family and mesenchymal typical class with high confidence scores in two cases; the other two cases showed only suggestive combined scores for GBM family and mesenchymal atypical class. The molecular profile of all cases closely aligned with that of adult-type GBM, IDH-wildtype, CNS WHO grade 4. All patients succumbed to the disease. In five cases with extensive leptomeningeal disease at diagnosis, the course was rapid, with median survival of 24\u2009days following palliative care. Only one case, with relatively localized disease at diagnosis, received chemoradiation therapy and survived 535\u2009days, raising the possibility that early diagnosis and timely treatment could improve outcome. A detailed list of previously reported cases is provided in a supplementary table.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2. Study type and methodology\n3. Population characteristics\n4.

Although TP53 mutations are prevalent in glioblastoma (GBM), the mechanisms by which TP53 regulates iron metabolism remain elusive. We reveal an imbalance iron homeostasis in GBM via TCGA database analysis. TP53 mutations disrupted iron homeostasis in GBM, characterized by elevated total iron levels and reduced ferritin (FTH). The gain-of-function effect triggered by TP53 mutations upregulates itchy E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (ITCH) protein expression in astrocytes, leading to FTH degradation and an increase in free iron levels. TP53-mut astrocytes were more tolerant to the high iron environment induced by exogenous ferric ammonium citrate (FAC), but the increase in intracellular free iron made them more sensitive to Erastin-induced ferroptosis. Interestingly, we found that Erastin combined with FAC treatment significantly increased ferroptosis. These findings provide new insights for drug development and therapeutic modalities for GBM patients with TP53 mutations from iron metabolism perspectives.\n\nConsider:\n1.

While some studies suggest a survival advantage for gcGB patients, the underlying causes remain elusive. GcGBs are associated with TP53 mutations, and gcs were shown to accumulate DNA double-strand breaks and show deficient mitosis, potentially triggering cellular senescence programs. Epigenetic clocks have emerged as valuable tools for assessing tumor-induced age acceleration (DNAMethAgeAcc), which has lately proved itself as prognostic biomarker in glioblastoma. Our study aimed to comprehensively analyze the methylome and key metabolic proteins of gcGBs, hypothesizing that they undergo cellular aging programs compared to non-gcGBs. A total of 310 epigenetically classified GBs, including 26 gcGBs, and nine adults with malignant gliomas allocating to pediatric high-grade glioma molecular subclasses (summarized as "pediatric GB") were included. DNAMethAgeAcc was computed by subtraction of chronological patient ages from DNA methylome-derived age estimations and its increase was associated with better survival within gcGB and non-gcGB. GcGBs were significantly more often allocated to the subgroup with increased DNAMethAgeAcc and demonstrated the highest DNAMethAgeAcc. Hypothetical senescence/aging-induced changes of the tumor microenvironment were addressed by tumor deconvolution, which was able to identify a cluster enriched for tumors with increased DNAMethAgeAcc. Key metabolic protein expression did not differ between gcGB and non-gcGB and tumor with versus without increased DNAMethAgeAcc but for elevated levels of one single mitochondrial marker, anti-mitochondrial protein MT-C02, in gcGBs. With its sped-up epigenetic aging, gcGB presented as the epigenetic oldest GB variant in our cohort. Whereas the correlation between accelerated tumor-intrinsic epigenetic aging and cellular senescence in gcGB stays elusive, fostering epigenetic aging programs in GB might be of interest for future exploration of alternative treatment options in GB patients.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Using gene editing protocol based on CRISPR-Cas 9 with cytidine deaminase, we introduced point mutations into U87MG glioblastoma cells to establish modified cell lines with heterozygous IDH1 R132H, homozygous TP53 R248Q and heterozygous IDH1 R132H, homozygous TP53 R248Q genotypes. A comparative study of cell migration on major ECM components was carried out by high-content microscopy. IDH1 R132H mutation introduced to U87MG glioblastoma cells was shown to decrease the migration speed on Matrigel and collagen IV substrates compared to the wild-type. This data were supported by cell adhesion quantification via the lateral shift assay performed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). TP53 R248Q mutation increased cell adhesion to various substrates and significantly promoted cell migration on hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate but did not change the migration rates on laminin and collagens IV and I. A double-mutant genotype produced by consequently introducing IDH1 R132H and TP53 R248Q to parental glioblastoma cells was characterized by the highest migration among all the cell lines, with particularly faster motility on chondroitin sulfate. These findings underscore the complex interactions between glioma cells, with the most important driver mutations and specific ECM components regulating cancer cell migration, offering valuable insights for potential therapeutic targets in glioma treatment.\n\nConsider:\n1.

This subtype is associated with significant heterogeneity, chemoresistance, early recurrence, metastasis, and poor patient survival. FOXM1 is a cancer-promoting transcription factor that plays a critical role in TNBC and other highly aggressive cancers by driving cell proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance. In TNBC, mutations in the TP53 gene-detected in approximately 80% of patients-lead to the overexpression of FOXM1, making it a promising therapeutic target. Beyond TNBC, FOXM1 is implicated in other solid cancers, such as brain (glioblastoma), lung, and pancreatic cancers, and is considered an Achilles' heel of aggressive cancers. Despite its potential as a therapeutic target, there are currently no FDA-approved FOXM1 inhibitors, and none have advanced to clinical trials. This review explores the role of FOXM1 in cancer progression and highlights the current status of efforts to develop effective FOXM1 inhibitors.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from GBM cells contain important biomarkers, such as microRNAs, proteins, and DNA mutations, which are involved in tumor progression, invasion, and resistance to treatment. Identifying surface markers on these EVs is crucial for their isolation and potential use in noninvasive diagnosis. This study aimed to use tumor-derived explants to investigate the surface markers of EVs and explore their role as diagnostic biomarkers for GBM. Tumor explants from nine GBM patients without IDH1/IDH2 mutations or 1p-19q co-deletion were cultured to preserve both tumor viability and cytoarchitecture. EVs were collected from the tumor microenvironment using differential centrifugation, filtration, and membrane affinity binding. Their surface protein composition was analyzed through multiplex protein assays. RNA-Seq data from TCGA and GTEx datasets, along with in silico single-cell RNA-seq data, were used to assess EV surface biomarker expression across large GBM patient cohorts. The in vitro model successfully replicated the tumor microenvironment and produced EVs with distinct surface markers. Biomarker analysis in large datasets revealed specific expression patterns unique to GBM patients compared with healthy controls. These markers demonstrated potential as a GBM-specific signature and were correlated with clinical data. Furthermore, in silico single-cell RNA-seq provided detailed insights into biomarker distribution across different cell types within the tumor. This study underscores the efficacy of the tumor-derived explant model and its potential to advance the understanding of GBM biology and EV production. A key innovation is the isolation of EVs from a model that faithfully mimics the tumor's original cytoarchitecture, offering a deeper understanding of the cells involved in EV release. The identified EV surface markers represent promising targets for enhancing EV isolation and optimizing their use as diagnostic tools. Moreover, further investigation into their molecular cargo may provide crucial insights into tumor characteristics and evolution.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

Approximately 8% of GBM cases exhibit genomic alterations in fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs), particularly FGFR1 and FGFR3. Next-generation sequencing techniques have identified various FGFR3 fusions in GBM. This report presents a novel FGFR3 fusion with fatty acid synthase (FASN) in a 41-year-old male diagnosed with GBM. The patient presented with a persistent headache, and imaging revealed a right frontal lobe lesion. Surgical resection and subsequent histopathology confirmed GBM. Initial NGS analysis showed no mutations in the IDH1, IDH2 or H3F3 genes, but revealed a TERT promoter mutation and CDKN2A/2B and PTEN deletions. Postoperative treatment included radiotherapy and temozolomide. Despite initial management, recurrence occurred four months post-diagnosis, confirmed by MRI and histology. A second surgery identified a novel FGFR3-FASN fusion, alongside increased Ki67 expression. The recurrence was managed with regorafenib and bevacizumab, though complications like hand-foot syndrome and radiation necrosis arose. Despite initial improvement, the patient died 15 months after diagnosis. This case underscores the importance of understanding GBM's molecular landscape for effective treatment strategies. The novel FGFR3-FASN fusion suggests potential implications for GBM recurrence and lipid metabolism. Further studies are warranted to explore FGFR3-FASN's role in GBM and its therapeutic targeting.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2. Study type and methodology\n3.

ALDH1A1 is a primary metabolic enzyme impacting the outcome of chemotherapy, including temozolomide. High expression of ALDH1A1 is associated with poor prognosis in multiple cancers, suggesting PPIs may have a negative impact on survival. Real-world data on GBM patients was annotated from electronic medical records (EMR) according to the prospective observational study, XCELSIOR (NCT03793088). Patients with known <i>IDH1/2</i> mutations were excluded. Causal effects on survival were analyzed using a multivariate, time-varying Cox Proportional Hazard (CPH) model with stratifications including <i>MGMT</i> methylation status, age, sex, duration of corticosteroid use, extent of resection, starting standard-of-care, and PPI use. EMR data from 554 GBM patients across 225 cancer centers was collected, with 72% of patients receiving care from academic medical centers. Patients treated with PPIs (51%) had numerically lower median overall survival (mOS) and 2-year OS rates in the total population and across most strata, with the greatest difference for MGMT-methylated patients (mOS 29.2 vs. 40.1 months). In a time-varying multivariate CPH analysis of the above strata, PPIs caused an adverse effect on survival (HR 1.67 [95% CI: 1.15-2.44], <i>P</i>\u2005=\u2005.007). Evidence from a nationwide cancer registry has suggested PPIs have a negative impact on OS for GBM patients, particularly those with <i>MGMT</i> promoter methylation. This suggests PPIs should be avoided for prophylactic management of gastrointestinal toxicity in patients with GBM receiving chemoradiotherapy.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

However, the inherent heterogeneity of GBM often results in suboptimal outcomes, particularly due to varying degrees of resistance to TMZ. Over the past several decades, O<sup>6</sup>-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT)-mediated DNA repair pathway has been extensively investigated as a target to overcome TMZ resistance. Nonetheless, the combination of small molecule covalent MGMT inhibitors with TMZ and other chemotherapeutic agents has frequently led to adverse clinical effects. Recently, additional mechanisms contributing to TMZ resistance have been identified, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, overactivation of intracellular signalling pathways, energy metabolism reprogramming or survival autophagy, and changes in tumor microenvironment (TME). These findings suggest that novel therapeutic strategies targeting these mechanisms hold promise for overcoming TMZ resistance in GBM patients. In this review, we summarize the latest advancements in understanding the mechanisms underlying intrinsic and acquired TMZ resistance. Additionally, we compile various small-molecule compounds with potential to mitigate chemoresistance in GBM. These mechanism-based compounds may enhance the sensitivity of GBM to TMZ and related chemotherapeutic agents, thereby improving overall survival rates in clinical practice.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Neuropathological diagnostic precision and clinical follow-up treatment has been further increased by combining DNA methylation profiling with targeted panel sequencing. A few new, molecularly defined tumor subtypes have been proposed, among others, a glioneuronal tumor with <i>ATRX</i> alteration, kinase fusion and anaplastic features (in its abbreviated form named GTAKA) and the de novo replication repair deficient glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype both having either distinct prognostic or therapeutic implications. Regarding the understanding of brain tumor development and progression, several novel mechanisms have been presented which might also be considered as treatment targets in the future, such as a) autonomous rhythmical Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in interconnected glioma cell networks driving tumor growth; b) transfer of mitochondria from normal astrocytes to glioma cells enhancing proliferation and self-renewal; c) brain endothelial cell remodeling upon matrix-metalloprotease 9 secretion by tumor cells metastasizing into the CNS and d) anti-tumor activity of microglia in CNS metastasis of breast cancer. Finally, in contrast to previous years, several very promising neurooncological treatment studies have been conducted, focusing on specific targets such as H3K27M or IDH1/2 mutations for which a proper neuropathological assessment is key. The continuous translation of potential new treatment targets using faster and precise diagnostic procedures will further pave the way for better individualized clinical care of neurooncological patients.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Gol1 demonstrated stability and anti-proliferative effects, altering gene expression patterns associated with tumor progression. The findings suggest Gol1 as a potential targeted therapy for GB patients with EGFR mutations.  \n\n2. **Methodology Overview**: Researchers designed Gol1 based on the secondary structure of the aptamer U2, using molecular dynamics simulations. The anti-proliferative effects of Gol1 were assessed in patient-derived GB cell cultures (G01 and BU881) with varying EGFR/EGFRvIII expression. Transcriptomic analysis was performed post-treatment to evaluate gene expression changes.  \n\n3. **Population Characteristics**: The study utilized two GB patient-derived continuous cell cultures, G01 and BU881, differing in EGFR and EGFRvIII expression levels. Specific patient demographics were not provided.  \n\n4. **Key Statistical Results**: Transcriptomic analysis of G01 cells post-Gol1 treatment showed significant upregulation of neurogenesis and differentiation-related genes, while genes involved in nuclear oncogenic signaling were downregulated. Exact fold changes and p-values were not specified in the abstract.  \n\n5. **Clinical Implications**: Gol1’s ability to modulate key oncogenic pathways suggests its potential as a targeted therapy for EGFR-mutant GB, particularly EGFRvIII-positive tumors. This study supports further investigation into aptamer-based therapies as an alternative or adjunct to existing treatments like immunotherapy and tumor-treating fields (TTF).  \n\nThis research contributes to the understanding of how EGFR mutations influence treatment response and highlights a novel therapeutic avenue for GB patients with EGFR/EGFRvIII alterations.\n\nArticle PMID:39906459\n### **Summary of Findings Related to GBM Mutations and Treatment Effectiveness**  \n\n#### **Main Findings and Conclusions:**  \n- **PD-L1 expression** was observed in **73.3% (33/45) of glioma cases**, including **75% (27/36) of GBM cases**.  \n- **IDH1 (R132H) mutation was inversely correlated with PD-L1 expression (p < 0.05)**, suggesting differing immune landscapes in IDH1-mutant vs. wild-type gliomas.  \n- No statistically significant correlation was found between **PD-L1 expression and glioma grade**.  \n- The study supports **PD-L1 as a potential immunotherapy target** in GBM, indicating the need for further research into combination therapies.  \n\n#### **Methodology Overview:**  \n- **Retrospective study** over **two years** at a tertiary care hospital.  \n- **45 glioma cases (grades 2–4)** analyzed using **immunohistochemistry (IHC)** for PD-L1 (clone 28-8) and IDH1 (R132H).  \n- PD-L1 expression assessed via **tumor proportion score (TPS)** with standardized cut-off values.  \n- **Chi-square test** used for statistical analysis (**p < 0.05** threshold).  \n\n#### **Population Characteristics:**  \n- **45 glioma patients**, including **36 GBM (grade 4) and 9 lower-grade (grade 2) gliomas**.  \n- Clinical and demographic data (age, sex, tumor location) were collected.  \n\n#### **Key Statistical Results:**  \n- **PD-L1 expression:**  \n  - **75% (27/36) of GBM cases**  \n  - **66.7% (6/9) of grade 2 gliomas**  \n- **Inverse correlation** between **PD-L1 and IDH1 (R132H) mutation (p < 0.05)**.  \n- No significant correlation between **PD-L1 expression and glioma grade**.  \n\n#### **Clinical Implications:**  \n- **PD-L1 presence in most GBM cases** suggests potential responsiveness to **immune checkpoint inhibitors**.  \n- **Inverse correlation with IDH1 mutation** indicates that **IDH1-wildtype GBMs may benefit more from PD-L1-targeted immunotherapy**.  \n- Findings support the\n\nArticle PMID:39864140\n### Summary  \n\nThis study investigates how **IDH1 mutations** influence immune checkpoint expression and potential treatment strategies in glioblastoma (GBM). Using two independent **TCGA NGS datasets** (n = 577 and n = 153), researchers analyzed **PDCD1 (PD-1) and CD274 (PD-L1) expression**, mutation profiles, miRNA regulation, and survival outcomes.  \n\n#### **Key Findings & Statistical Results:**  \n1. **IDH1 mutations (IDH1<sup>Mu</sup>) were present in 5.4% of GBM cases**, with varying prevalence across cohorts (4–31%).  \n2. **IDH1<sup>Mu</sup> was associated with improved overall survival (OS)** (p = 2.196e-3; p = 8.235e-5).  \n3. **PDCD1 and CD274 were significantly overexpressed in both IDH1<sup>Wt</sup> and IDH1<sup>Mu</sup> tumors** (p < 0.0001 for both), with higher expression correlating with **worse survival** (PDCD1: p = 0.009; CD274: p = 0.02).  \n4. **Distinct molecular pathways** were identified:  \n   - **IDH1<sup>Wt</sup> GBMs** showed **PTEN upregulation** and **MUC16 downregulation**.  \n   - **IDH1<sup>Mu</sup> GBMs** exhibited **PIK3R1 upregulation**, suggesting activation of the **PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway**.  \n5. **PIK3R1 and ITGB2 were identified as potential druggable targets**.  \n\n#### **Clinical Implications:**  \n- **Immunotherapy (e.g., PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors) may be beneficial in both IDH1<sup>Mu</sup> and IDH1<sup>Wt</sup> GBMs**, given the high PDCD1 and CD274 expression.  \n- **IDH1<sup>Mu</sup> GBMs may require a combination approach**, integrating **PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors** with immunotherapy due to PIK3R1 overexpression.  \n- Findings support **personalized treatment strategies** based on molecular profiling,\n\nArticle PMID:39835141\n### Summary  \n\n#### **Main Findings and Conclusions**  \nThis study introduces a new glioblastoma (GBM) molecular subgroup, G3/MMR, characterized by mismatch repair (MMR) mutations and high tumor mutation burden (TMB). Patients in this subgroup had significantly worse survival (median 3.25 months post-surgery) compared to other major subgroups (G1/EGFR, G3/NF1) and the overall cohort. However, one patient treated with nivolumab-ipilimumab immunotherapy demonstrated prolonged survival, suggesting a potential therapeutic approach for this aggressive subgroup.  \n\n#### **Methodology Overview**  \nThe study analyzed 218 GBM patients in a prospective cohort, classifying tumors into G1-G7 molecular subgroups based on MAPK pathway activation. Clinical, histologic, and molecular characteristics of G3/MMR tumors were compared with other GBMs, including those with iatrogenic high TMB.  \n\n#### **Population Characteristics**  \n- **Total cohort:** 218 GBM patients  \n- **G3/MMR subgroup:** 5 patients with germline MMR mutations (Lynch syndrome)  \n- **Key tumor features:** Midline/multifocal location, multinucleated giant cells, high TMB, specific mutations (e.g., *MSH2/MSH6*, biallelic *TP53* Arg mutations, *PIK3CA* p.R88Q, *PTEN* alterations)  \n\n#### **Key Statistical Results**  \n- **Median survival:** 3.25 months post-surgery for G3/MMR patients (significantly worse than other subgroups)  \n- **Incidence:** 1 in 7 tumors with multinucleated giant cells and p53 immunopositivity belong to G3/MMR  \n- **Therapeutic response:** One G3/MMR patient receiving nivolumab-ipilimumab had extended survival, indicating potential benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors  \n\n#### **Clinical Implications**  \n- **Risk stratification:** Identifying G3/MMR tumors is crucial for prognosis and treatment planning.  \n- **Immunotherapy potential:** Despite poor overall survival, immune checkpoint inhibitors (nivolumab-ipilimumab) may be effective in select G3/MMR patients.  \n- **Targeted therapy considerations:** High TMB and specific mutations (e.g., *PIK3CA*, *PTEN*) suggest possible responsiveness to emerging targeted treatments.\n\nArticle PMID:39684714\nThis study analyzed genetic mutations in 131 diffuse glioma patients (18 low-grade glioma [LGG], 113 high-grade glioma [HGG]) using next-generation sequencing (Illumina, 812-gene panel). Key findings include:  \n\n- **Mutation Prevalence:** LGG patients commonly had **IDH1/2 (78%)**, ATRX (33%), TP53 (44%), and PIK3CA (17%), while HGG patients showed frequent alterations in **CDKN2A/B (33%)**, TERTp (71%), PTEN (60%), TP53 (27%), and EGFR (40%).  \n- **Prognostic Markers:** **IDH1/2 mutations** were associated with better survival, whereas **TERTp mutation and PTEN deletion** indicated worse prognosis.  \n- **Treatment Impact:** In **IDH-wildtype GBM**, prior cancer history correlated with poorer overall survival (OS), while **re-operation and bevacizumab therapy improved OS**.  \n- **Targeted Therapy:** Nine patients received molecular-targeted treatments, though specific outcomes were not detailed.  \n\n### **Clinical Implications:**  \n- **IDH1/2 mutations** suggest better response to therapies and improved prognosis.  \n- **EGFR alterations (e.g., EGFRvIII)** were not explicitly analyzed but are common in HGG, supporting the rationale for EGFR-targeted therapies.  \n- **MGMT methylation status** was not reported, though it remains a key predictor of temozolomide efficacy.  \n- **TERTp and PTEN deletions** may indicate resistance to standard treatments and potential need for alternative strategies, such as immunotherapy or tumor-treating fields (TTF).  \n\nOverall, these findings reinforce the importance of molecular profiling in guiding personalized GBM treatment strategies, including targeted therapies and immunotherapy.\n\nArticle PMID:39586078\nThis case report examines the impact of immunotherapy in a patient with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS)-associated glioblastoma (GBM), characterized by a **p53 germline mutation, IDH-wildtype status, and MGMT unmethylation**. The patient, an **18-year-old female**, initially underwent **gross-total resection, radiation, and chemotherapy**. After suspected recurrence, she received **stereotactic radiosurgery, lomustine, procarbazine, and later bevacizumab**. Following further concerns for progression, **nivolumab (PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor) was introduced**, leading to **tumor regression within 5 months** and **progression-free survival exceeding 7 years**—a significant improvement over the **median GBM survival of 15 months**.  \n\nThis case suggests that **immune checkpoint inhibitors may be particularly effective in p53-mutated GBM**, potentially due to increased tumor immunogenicity. While limited to a single patient, these findings support further investigation into **immunotherapy for genetically defined GBM subtypes**, particularly those with **p53 mutations**.\n\nArticle PMID:39560080\nThis study investigated the molecular evolution of glioblastoma (GBM) and its impact on treatment response by analyzing paired initial and recurrent tumor samples from 106 patients. Using histopathologic, genomic, and epigenomic evaluations, the researchers identified early and late genetic alterations. TERT promoter mutations and CDKN2A homozygous deletions were early events, while alterations in EGFR, PTEN, and NF1 emerged later, contributing to tumor heterogeneity. \n\nEpigenomic changes varied, with some tumors becoming hypermethylated or hypomethylated over time. Notably, sarcomatous transformation, associated with NF1, TP53, and RB1 mutations, correlated with faster recurrence. Patients who developed somatic hypermutation after temozolomide treatment had significantly longer recurrence-free intervals and overall survival, which was linked to increased MGMT promoter methylation at four specific CpG sites. An epigenomic evolution signature based on DNA methylation changes at 347 CpG sites was also predictive of clinical outcomes.\n\nThese findings suggest that GBM mutations and epigenomic changes influence treatment response, with implications for personalized therapies. MGMT methylation status may predict temozolomide-induced hypermutation and improved survival, while mesenchymal transformation (TP53, NF1 mutations) may signal poorer prognosis. This highlights the need for molecular profiling to guide treatment strategies, including targeted therapies and immunotherapy.\n\nArticle PMID:39439623\n### Summary in Relation to Clinical Question  \n\n**Main Findings & Conclusions:**  \nThis review summarizes systemic therapies for malignant gliomas, emphasizing the role of chemotherapy and molecular markers in treatment response. In GBM, IDH-wildtype patients with MGMT promoter methylation benefit most from temozolomide (TMZ), with extended adjuvant TMZ improving outcomes over the standard 6-cycle regimen. Bevacizumab (BEV) monotherapy enhances progression-free survival and quality of life but does not significantly improve overall survival. Despite these advances, median survival remains limited (14–16 months), highlighting the need for further research into systemic treatments.  \n\n**Methodology Overview:**  \nThe study is a literature review analyzing existing research on chemotherapy and molecularly targeted treatments for gliomas, with a focus on systemic therapy approaches.  \n\n**Population Characteristics:**  \nThe review includes data on gliomas of various grades, particularly GBM (grade 4), and considers the impact of molecular markers such as IDH status and MGMT promoter methylation on treatment efficacy.  \n\n**Key Statistical Results:**  \n- **IDH-wildtype GBM with MGMT methylation:** Best response to TMZ.  \n- **Extended TMZ therapy:** Improves survival compared to the standard 6-cycle regimen.  \n- **BEV monotherapy:** Increases progression-free survival but does not significantly extend overall survival.  \n- **Median survival for GBM:** 14–16 months despite treatment advances.  \n\n**Clinical Implications:**  \n- **MGMT methylation status is critical** for predicting TMZ efficacy.  \n- **Extended TMZ therapy may be beneficial** beyond standard 6 cycles.  \n- **BEV can improve quality of life and delay progression** but does not significantly impact overall survival.  \n- **Further research is needed** to optimize systemic treatments, particularly for GBM patients with poor prognostic markers.  \n\nThis review provides insights into how molecular mutations influence GBM treatment response, emphasizing the need for more effective systemic therapies. However, it does not specifically address emerging treatments like immunotherapy or tumor-treating fields (TTF).\n\nProvide a comprehensive synthesis that:\n1. Begins with a brief overview\n2. Presents main findings, citing articles using their PMID numbers in square brackets [PMID:XXXXXX]\n3. Addresses contradictions or conflicts\n4. Notes limitations and gaps\n5. Concludes with clinical implications\n\nImportant: \n- Use PMID numbers in square brackets [PMID:XXXXXX] to cite findings\n- Each article summary begins with "Article PMID:XXXXXX", use these exact PMID numbers in your citations\n- Do not include a references section, citations will be added automatically'}], 'model': 'chatgpt-4o-latest', 'max_tokens': 4096, 'temperature': 0.7}}

We analyzed the frequency of PD-L1 expression in glioma samples. Methodology In this two-year retrospective study, 45 glioma cases of varying grades (grades 2 to 4) were examined at a tertiary care hospital. Tumor samples that were formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) were obtained from the pathology archives of the hospital. According to the WHO Classification of Central Nervous System Tumors, 5th edition, tumor grading and histopathological subtyping were carried out. PD-L1 antibody (clone 28-8) and IDH1 (R132H, clone QM002, Quartett Immunodiagnostika, 1:100 dilution) markers were used for immunohistochemistry (IHC). The sections underwent deparaffinization, rehydration, and antigen retrieval using Leica bond III staining platform. Based on the tumor proportion score (TPS), which is the proportion of viable tumor cells with membranous staining, PD-L1 expression was assessed. The literature's standardized cut-off values were used to determine positive expression. Staining intensity and tumor cell location were used to determine the status of IDH1 mutations. Age, sex, and tumor location were among the clinical and demographic information gathered about the patient. The association between PD-L1 expression, glioma grades, and IDH1 (R132H) mutation status was assessed statistically using SPSS software and a Chi-square test. The threshold for statistical significance was p < 0.05. For every IHC run, positive and negative controls were used as part of the quality control procedures. To reduce bias and guarantee consistency, two pathologists and post graduate residents independently reviewed the results. Results PD-L1 expression was found in 27 out of 36 (75%) grade 4 glioblastoma multiforme cases and six out of nine (66.7%) grade 2 gliomas. Overall, 33/45 (73.3%) of the gliomas had PD-L1 expression. However, PD-L1 expression and glioma grade did not correlate in a statistically significant way. IDH1 (R132H) expression and PD-L1 were found to be inversely correlated (p < 0.05). Conclusion The findings suggest that PD-L1 may be a promising therapeutic target, even in the absence of significant grade-specific trends by\xa0demonstrating PD-L1 presence in the majority of glioma cases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in GBM immunotherapy.

Non-canonical mutations such as BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>, found in 1-2% of GBMs, activate the MEK-ERK signaling pathway. This mutation can be targeted by small molecule inhibitors, offering therapeutic potential for GBM. In this case report, we describe the management of a 67-year-old male with BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> -mutant GBM, who experienced both local clonal and distant non-clonal BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> -mutant recurrences. Initial treatment involved surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and temozolomide (TMZ). Subsequent recurrences were managed with re-resection and dabrafenib/trametinib combination therapy. Notably, a new, non-clonal BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> -negative tumor developed in a distant location, highlighting the challenge of clonal evolution and resistance in GBM management. The patient's disease ultimately progressed despite multiple lines of therapy, including targeted inhibition. Identifying mechanisms of resistance and tailoring flexible treatment approaches are essential for advancing outcomes in BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> -mutant GBM. This case emphasizes the value of molecular profiling in personalizing treatment for patients with multifocal disease. The evolving nature of these tumors requires persistent clinical monitoring and treatment adjustments based on tissue diagnostics.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors show promise in cancer therapy, yet their efficacy in glioblastomas, particularly with IDH1 mutations, remains unclear. This study analyzed two independent NGS datasets (n = 577 and n = 153) from TCGA to investigate the expression of PDCD1 and CD274 in glioblastomas and their relationship with IDH1 mutations. We used cBioPortal for mutation analysis, RNA seq for expression analysis, miRDB and miRabel for differential expression of miRNAs, and Kaplan-Meier for survival prediction. We found that 5.4% of glioblastomas harbored IDH1 mutations, correlating with improved overall survival (OS) (p = 2.196e-3). Different glioblastoma cohorts showed a diverse IDH1 mutational prevalence (4-31%). Despite this, IDH1<sup>Mu</sup> was consistently associated with better OS (p = 8.235e-5). Notably, PDCD1 and CD274 were statistically significantly highly expressed in both IDH1<sup>Wt</sup> (p < 0.0001) and IDH1<sup>Mu</sup> tumors (p < 0.0001), with higher expression linked to poorer survival outcomes (PDCD1: p = 0.009; CD274: p = 0.02). Differential co-expression analyses revealed distinct gene and miRNA profiles for IDH1<sup>Wt</sup> and IDH1<sup>Mu</sup> glioblastomas, with specific upregulation of PTEN and downregulation of MUC16 in IDH1<sup>Wt</sup>, and upregulation of PIK3R1 in IDH1<sup>Mu</sup>. Additionally, PIK3R1 and ITGB2 emerged as critical druggable targets. Our findings indicate that PDCD1 and CD274 are highly expressed irrespective of IDH1 mutation statuses, suggesting that glioblastomas could benefit from immunotherapy. Moreover, IDH1<sup>Mu</sup> glioblastomas may require a combination of PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors and immunotherapy due to PIK3R1 overexpression.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors show promise in cancer therapy, yet their efficacy in glioblastomas, particularly with IDH1 mutations, remains unclear. This study analyzed two independent NGS datasets (n = 577 and n = 153) from TCGA to investigate the expression of PDCD1 and CD274 in glioblastomas and their relationship with IDH1 mutations. We used cBioPortal for mutation analysis, RNA seq for expression analysis, miRDB and miRabel for differential expression of miRNAs, and Kaplan-Meier for survival prediction. We found that 5.4% of glioblastomas harbored IDH1 mutations, correlating with improved overall survival (OS) (p = 2.196e-3). Different glioblastoma cohorts showed a diverse IDH1 mutational prevalence (4-31%). Despite this, IDH1<sup>Mu</sup> was consistently associated with better OS (p = 8.235e-5). Notably, PDCD1 and CD274 were statistically significantly highly expressed in both IDH1<sup>Wt</sup> (p < 0.0001) and IDH1<sup>Mu</sup> tumors (p < 0.0001), with higher expression linked to poorer survival outcomes (PDCD1: p = 0.009; CD274: p = 0.02). Differential co-expression analyses revealed distinct gene and miRNA profiles for IDH1<sup>Wt</sup> and IDH1<sup>Mu</sup> glioblastomas, with specific upregulation of PTEN and downregulation of MUC16 in IDH1<sup>Wt</sup>, and upregulation of PIK3R1 in IDH1<sup>Mu</sup>. Additionally, PIK3R1 and ITGB2 emerged as critical druggable targets. Our findings indicate that PDCD1 and CD274 are highly expressed irrespective of IDH1 mutation statuses, suggesting that glioblastomas could benefit from immunotherapy. Moreover, IDH1<sup>Mu</sup> glioblastomas may require a combination of PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors and immunotherapy due to PIK3R1 overexpression.\n\nProvide a focused summary that:\n1.

In the following 20 years, it has lived up to expectations. A substantial body of evidence has demonstrated that it is closely related to the development, metastasis, migration, and drug resistance of malignant tumors. In recent years, research on the MSI protein has advanced, and many novel viewpoints and drug resistance attempts have been derived; for example, tumor protein p53 mutations and MSI-binding proteins lead to resistance to protein arginine N-methyltransferase 5-targeted therapy in lymphoma patients. Moreover, the high expression of MSI2 in pancreatic cancer might suppress its development and progression. As a significant member of the MSI family, MSI2 is closely associated with multiple malignant tumors, including hematological disorders, common abdominal tumors, and other tumor types (e.g., glioblastoma, breast cancer). MSI2 is highly expressed in the majority of tumors and is related to a poor disease prognosis. However, its specific expression levels and regulatory mechanisms may differ based on the tumor type. This review summarizes the research progress related to MSI2 in recent years, including its occurrence, migration mechanism, and drug resistance, as well as the prospect of developing tumor immunosuppressants and biomarkers.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Although the survival is generally dismal for glioblastoma patients, risk stratification and the identification of high-risk subgroups is important for prompt and aggressive management. The G1-G7 molecular subgroup classification based on the MAPK pathway activation has offered for the first time a non-redundant, all-inclusive classification of adult glioblastoma. Five patients from the large, 218-patient, prospective cohort showed germline mutations in mismatch repair (MMR) genes (Lynch syndrome) and a significantly worse median survival of 3.25 months post-surgery than those from the G1/EGFR and G3/NF1 major subgroups, or from the rest of the cohort adjusted for age. These rare tumors were assigned to a new subgroup, G3/MMR, a G3/NF1 subgroup spin-off, as they generally show genomic alterations leading to RAS activation, such as <i>NF1</i> and <i>PTPN11</i> mutations. An integrated clinical, histologic and molecular analysis of the G3/MMR tumors showed distinct characteristics as compared to other glioblastomas, including those with iatrogenic high tumor mutation burden (TMB), warranting a separate subgroup. Prior history of cancer, midline location or multifocality, presence of multinucleated giant cells (MGCs), positive p53 and MMR immunohistochemistry, and specific molecular characteristics, including high TMB, <i>MSH2</i>/<i>MSH6</i> alterations, biallelic <i>TP53</i> Arg mutations and co-occurring <i>PIK3CA</i> p.R88Q and <i>PTEN</i> alterations, alert to this high-risk G3/MMR subgroup. The MGCs and p53 immunohistochemistry analysis in G1-G7 subgroups showed that one in 7 tumors with these characteristics is a G3/MMR glioblastoma. The FDA-approved first-line therapy for many advanced solid tumors consists of nivolumab-ipilimumab immune checkpoint inhibitors. One G3/MMR patient received this regimen and survived much longer than the rest, setting a proof-of-principle example for the treatment of these very aggressive G3/MMR glioblastomas.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Disruption of the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway in tumor cells enhances the effectiveness of radiotherapy drugs, while increased mutational burden following tumor cell damage also facilitates the efficacy of immunotherapy. The ATRX gene, located on chromosome X, plays a crucial role in DDR. The aim of this research is to elucidate the correlation between ATRX mutations and GBM. Dataset obtained from TCGA-GBM were conducted an analysis on the genomic features, biological characteristics, immunopathological markers, and clinical prognosis of patients carrying ATRX mutations. Our findings revealed a significantly elevated level of microsatellite instability in individuals with ATRX mutants, along with significant alterations in the receptor-tyrosine kinase (RTK)-ras pathway among patients exhibiting combined ATRX mutations. TCGA-GBM patients with concurrent ATRX mutations exhibited sensitivity to 26 chemotherapeutic and anticancer drugs, which exerted their effects by modulating the DDR of tumor cells through highly correlated mechanisms involving the RTK-ras pathway. Additionally, we observed an enrichment of ATRX mutations in specific pathways associated with DDR among TCGA-GBM patients. Our model also demonstrated prolonged overall survival in patients carrying ATRX mutations, particularly showing strong predictive value for 3- and 5-year survival rates. Furthermore, additional protective factors such as younger age, female gender, combined IDH mutations, and TP53 mutations were identified. The results underscore the protective role and prognostic significance of ATRX mutations in GBM as a potential therapeutic target and biomarker for patient survival.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Despite current therapies, the 5-year survival rate is 5%-10%. The authors report a case with a durable long-term response to immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibition in a patient with LFS-associated GBM. An 18-year-old female presented after a syncopal episode and left leg weakness and was found to have a right frontal tumor. She underwent gross-total resection of the tumor (grade IV giant cell GBM IDH-wildtype, MGMT unmethylated, associated with a p53 germline mutation), radiation, and chemotherapy. On later imaging, increased enhancement was demonstrated, which raised concerns for tumor recurrence, and she underwent stereotactic radiosurgery followed by lomustine and procarbazine. These agents were later replaced with bevacizumab after a second resection, negative for recurrent glioma. Subsequently, nivolumab was added, given concerns for tumor progression, and the patient showed improvement within 5 months. The patient has continued nivolumab monotherapy and has had progression-free survival for more than 7 years. Despite advances in treatment, the median survival of patients with GBM is only 15 months. This case highlights the potential of immunotherapy with PD-L1 checkpoint inhibition in improving outcomes for LFS-associated GBM patients. https://thejns.org/doi/10.3171/CASE24539.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Despite current therapies, the 5-year survival rate is 5%-10%. The authors report a case with a durable long-term response to immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibition in a patient with LFS-associated GBM. An 18-year-old female presented after a syncopal episode and left leg weakness and was found to have a right frontal tumor. She underwent gross-total resection of the tumor (grade IV giant cell GBM IDH-wildtype, MGMT unmethylated, associated with a p53 germline mutation), radiation, and chemotherapy. On later imaging, increased enhancement was demonstrated, which raised concerns for tumor recurrence, and she underwent stereotactic radiosurgery followed by lomustine and procarbazine. These agents were later replaced with bevacizumab after a second resection, negative for recurrent glioma. Subsequently, nivolumab was added, given concerns for tumor progression, and the patient showed improvement within 5 months. The patient has continued nivolumab monotherapy and has had progression-free survival for more than 7 years. Despite advances in treatment, the median survival of patients with GBM is only 15 months. This case highlights the potential of immunotherapy with PD-L1 checkpoint inhibition in improving outcomes for LFS-associated GBM patients. https://thejns.org/doi/10.3171/CASE24539.\n\nProvide a focused summary that:\n1.

Necroptosis, a pathological hallmark of GBM, is poorly understood in terms of its role in prognosis, tumor microenvironment (TME) alteration, and immunotherapy. We assessed the expression of 55 necroptosis-related genes in GBM and normal brain tissues. We identified necroptosis-stratified clusters using Uni-Cox and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression to establish the 10-gene Glioblastoma Necroptosis Index (GNI). GNI demonstrated significant prognostic efficacy in the TCGA dataset (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u2009160) and internal validation dataset (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u2009345) and in external validation cohorts (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u2009591). The GNI-high subgroup displayed a mesenchymal phenotype, lacking the IDH1 mutation, and MGMT methylation. This subgroup was characterized by significant enrichment in inflammatory and humoral immune pathways with prominent cell adhesion molecules (CD44 and ICAM1), inflammatory cytokines (TGFB1, IL1B, and IL10), and chemokines (CX3CL1, CXCL9, and CCL5). The TME in this subgroup showed elevated infiltration of M0 macrophages, neutrophils, mast cells, and regulatory T cells. GNI-related genes appeared to limit macrophage polarization, as confirmed by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. The top 30% high-risk score subset exhibited increased CD8 T cell infiltration and enhanced cytolytic activity. GNI showed promise in predicting responses to immunotherapy and targeted treatment. Our study highlights the role of necroptosis-related genes in glioblastoma (GBM) and their effects on the tumor microenvironment and patient prognosis. TheGNI demonstrates potential as a prognostic marker and provides insights into immune characteristics and treatment responsiveness.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

Finally, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression was performed on the expression profiles of S2, S3 and S4 in TCGA-GBM and RPPA to determine the respective corresponding best predictive model. Four novel molecular subtypes were classified. Specifically, S1 exhibited a low proliferative profile; S2 exhibited the profile of high proliferation, IDH1 mutation, TP53 mutation and deletion; S3 was characterized by high immune scores, innate immunity and adaptive immune infiltration scores, with the lowest TIDE score and was most likely to benefit from immunotherapy; S4 was characterized by high proliferation, EGFR amplification, and high protein abundance, and was the most suitable subtype for bevacizumab. LASSO analysis constructed the best prediction model composed of 13 genes in S2 with an accuracy of 96.7%, and the prediction model consisting of 17 genes in S3 with an accuracy of 86.7%, and screened 14 genes as components of the best prediction model in S4 with an accuracy of 93%.

We leverage in silico tools to investigate whether the occurrence of mutations in proteins previously described as immunogenic and highly expressed by glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), such as Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1), Phosphatase and Tensin homolog (PTEN) and Tumor Protein 53 (TP53), may be contributing to the differential presentation of immunogenic epitopes. We recovered Class I MHC binding information from wild-type and mutated proteins using the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB). After that, we built peptide-MHC (pMHC-I) models in HLA-arena, followed by hierarchical clustering analysis based on electrostatic surface features from each complex. We identified point mutations that are determinants for the presentation of a set of peptides from TP53 protein. We point to structural features in the pMHC-I complexes of wild-type and mutated peptides, which may play a role in the recognition of CD8 T cells. To further explore these features, we performed 100\xa0ns molecular dynamics simulations for the peptide pairs (wt/mut) selected. In pursuit of novel therapeutic targets for GBM treatment, we selected peptides where our predictive results indicated that mutations would not disrupt epitope presentation, thereby maintaining a specific CD8 T cell immune response. These peptides hold potential for future GBM interventions, including peptide-based or mRNA vaccine development applications.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

We leverage in silico tools to investigate whether the occurrence of mutations in proteins previously described as immunogenic and highly expressed by glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), such as Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1), Phosphatase and Tensin homolog (PTEN) and Tumor Protein 53 (TP53), may be contributing to the differential presentation of immunogenic epitopes. We recovered Class I MHC binding information from wild-type and mutated proteins using the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB). After that, we built peptide-MHC (pMHC-I) models in HLA-arena, followed by hierarchical clustering analysis based on electrostatic surface features from each complex. We identified point mutations that are determinants for the presentation of a set of peptides from TP53 protein. We point to structural features in the pMHC-I complexes of wild-type and mutated peptides, which may play a role in the recognition of CD8 T cells. To further explore these features, we performed 100\xa0ns molecular dynamics simulations for the peptide pairs (wt/mut) selected. In pursuit of novel therapeutic targets for GBM treatment, we selected peptides where our predictive results indicated that mutations would not disrupt epitope presentation, thereby maintaining a specific CD8 T cell immune response. These peptides hold potential for future GBM interventions, including peptide-based or mRNA vaccine development applications.\n\nProvide a focused summary that:\n1.

To address these issues and personalise treatment approaches, we aimed to develop and validate robust multiomics molecular subtypes of IDHwt-GBM. Through this, we sought to uncover the distinct molecular signatures underlying these subtypes, paving the way for improved diagnosis and targeted therapy for this challenging disease. To identify stable molecular subtypes among 184 IDHwt-GBM patients from TCGA, we used the consensus clustering method to consolidate the results from ten advanced multiomics clustering approaches based on mRNA, lncRNA, and mutation data. We developed subtype prediction models using the PAM and machine learning algorithms based on mRNA and MRI data for enhanced clinical utility. These models were validated in five independent datasets, and an online interactive system was created. We conducted a comprehensive assessment of the clinical impact, drug treatment response, and molecular associations of the IDHwt-GBM subtypes. In the TCGA cohort, two molecular subtypes, class 1 and class 2, were identified through multiomics clustering of IDHwt-GBM patients. There was a significant difference in survival between Class 1 and Class 2 patients, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.68 [1.15-2.47]. This difference was validated in other datasets (CGGA: HR\u2009=\u20091.75[1.04, 2.94]; CPTAC: HR\u2009=\u20091.79[1.09-2.91]; GALSS: HR\u2009=\u20091.66[1.09-2.54]; UCSF: HR\u2009=\u20091.33[1.00-1.77]; UPENN HR\u2009=\u20091.29[1.04-1.58]). Additionally, class 2 was more sensitive to treatment with radiotherapy combined with temozolomide, and this sensitivity was validated in the GLASS cohort. Correspondingly, class 2 and class 1 exhibited significant differences in mutation patterns, enriched pathways, programmed cell death (PCD), and the tumour immune microenvironment. Class 2 had more mutation signatures associated with defective DNA mismatch repair (P\u2009=\u20090.0021). Enriched pathways of differentially expressed genes in class 1 and class 2 (P-adjust\u2009<\u20090.05) were mainly related to ferroptosis, the PD-1 checkpoint pathway, the JAK-STAT signalling pathway, and other programmed cell death and immune-related pathways. The different cell death modes and immune microenvironments were validated across multiple datasets. Finally, our developed survival prediction model, which integrates molecular subtypes, age, and sex, demonstrated clinical benefits based on the decision curve in the test set. We deployed the molecular subtyping prediction model and survival prediction model online, allowing interactive use and facilitating user convenience.

Pediatric glioblastoma is a rare and aggressive brain tumor that presents unique challenges in treatment. It differs from its adult counterpart in terms of genetic and molecular characteristics. Its incidence is relatively low, but the prognosis remains grim due to its aggressive behavior. Diagnosis relies on imaging techniques and histopathological analysis. The rarity of the disease underscores the need for effective treatment strategies. In recent years, the quest to understand and manage pediatric glioblastoma has seen a significant shift towards unraveling the intricate landscape of biomarkers. Surgery remains a cornerstone of glioblastoma management, aiming to resect as much of the tumor as possible. Glioblastoma's infiltrative nature presents challenges in achieving a complete surgical resection. This comprehensive review delves into the realm of pediatric glioblastoma biomarkers, shedding light on their potential to not only revolutionize diagnostics but also shape therapeutic strategies. From personalized treatment selection to the development of targeted therapies, the potential impact of these biomarkers on clinical outcomes is undeniable. Moreover, this review underscores the substantial implications of biomarker-driven approaches for therapeutic interventions. All advancements in targeted therapies and immunotherapy hold promise for the treatment of pediatric glioblastoma. The genetic profiling of tumors allows for personalized approaches, potentially improving treatment efficacy. The ethical dilemmas surrounding pediatric cancer treatment, particularly balancing potential benefits with risks, are complex. Ongoing clinical trials and preclinical research suggest exciting avenues for future interventions.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2. Study type and methodology\n3.

With an evolving understanding of its underlying biology, there is an urgent need to identify prognostic molecular groups that can be subject to targeted therapy. This study established a cohort of 124 sequential glioblastomas from a tertiary hospital and aimed to find correlations between molecular features and survival outcomes. Comprehensive molecular characterization of the cohort revealed prevalent alterations as previously described, such as TERT promoter mutations and involvement of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR, CK4/6-CDKN2A/B-RB1, and p14ARF-MDM2-MDM4-p53 pathways. MGMT promoter methylation is a significant predictor of improved overall survival, aligned with previous data. Conversely, age showed a marginal association with higher mortality. Multivariate analysis to account for the effect of MGMT promoter methylation and age showed that, in contrast to other published series, this cohort demonstrated improved survival for tumors harboring PTEN mutations, and that there was no observed difference for most other molecular alterations, including EGFR amplification, RB1 loss, or the coexistence of EGFR amplification and deletion/exon skipping (EGFRvIII). Despite limitations in sample size, this study contributes data to the molecular landscape of glioblastomas, prompting further investigations to examine these findings more closely in larger cohorts.\n\nConsider:\n1.

GTKM leverages protein-protein interactions to graphically display differentially expressed genes (DEGs) on a 2-dimensional contour plot, offering a more nuanced understanding of gene interactions and expression patterns compared to traditional heatmap methods. The research demonstrates GTKM's utility through four case studies on glioblastoma (GBM) datasets, focusing on survival analysis, subtype identification, IDH1 mutation analysis, and drug sensitivities of different tumor cell lines. Additionally, a prototype website has been developed to showcase these findings, indicating the method's adaptability for various cancer types. The study reveals that GTKM effectively identifies gene patterns associated with different clinical outcomes in GBM, and its profiles enable the identification of sub-gene signature patterns crucial for predicting survival. The methodology promises significant advancements in precision medicine, providing a powerful tool for understanding complex gene interactions and identifying potential therapeutic targets in cancer treatment.\n\nConsider:\n1.

This study reclassified the adult diffuse glioma (ADG) into astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, and glioblastoma (GBM) according to the new tumor classification. The association of TERT promoter (pTERT) mutation, MGMT methylation, and CD47/TIGIT expression with patient prognosis was investigated. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the expression levels of CD47 and TIGIT in tumor tissues were significantly higher than those in normal brain tissues. CD47 levels were higher in GBM and grade 4 astrocytoma tissues. TIGIT expression was also higher in patients with GBM. The high expressions of CD47, TIGIT, and CD47/TIGIT were positively correlated with <i>MGMT</i> unmethylation but not p<i>TERT</i> mutation. Moreover, <i>MGMT</i> unmethylation was associated with poor overall survival in astrocytoma. High CD47, TIGIT, and CD47/TIGIT levels were associated with significantly reduced survival in ADG and GBM. GBM, <i>MGMT</i> unmethylation, and high CD47 expression were independent prognostic factors for overall survival in ADG. Collectively, these results showed that the <i>MGMT</i> unmethylation and high levels of CD47 and TIGIT are associated with a poor prognosis in ADG. Patients with high CD47 and TIGIT expression may benefit from anti-CD47 and TIGIT immunotherapy.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2. Study type and methodology\n3.

This study reclassified the adult diffuse glioma (ADG) into astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, and glioblastoma (GBM) according to the new tumor classification. The association of TERT promoter (pTERT) mutation, MGMT methylation, and CD47/TIGIT expression with patient prognosis was investigated. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the expression levels of CD47 and TIGIT in tumor tissues were significantly higher than those in normal brain tissues. CD47 levels were higher in GBM and grade 4 astrocytoma tissues. TIGIT expression was also higher in patients with GBM. The high expressions of CD47, TIGIT, and CD47/TIGIT were positively correlated with <i>MGMT</i> unmethylation but not p<i>TERT</i> mutation. Moreover, <i>MGMT</i> unmethylation was associated with poor overall survival in astrocytoma. High CD47, TIGIT, and CD47/TIGIT levels were associated with significantly reduced survival in ADG and GBM. GBM, <i>MGMT</i> unmethylation, and high CD47 expression were independent prognostic factors for overall survival in ADG. Collectively, these results showed that the <i>MGMT</i> unmethylation and high levels of CD47 and TIGIT are associated with a poor prognosis in ADG. Patients with high CD47 and TIGIT expression may benefit from anti-CD47 and TIGIT immunotherapy.\n\nProvide a focused summary that:\n1. Highlights main findings and conclusions\n2.

Patients receive surgery and chemoradiotherapy but tumors almost always fatally recur. Using RNA sequencing data from 107 pairs of pre- and post-standard treatment locally recurrent IDHwt GBM tumors, we identify two responder subtypes based on longitudinal changes in gene expression. In two thirds of patients, a specific subset of genes is upregulated from primary to recurrence (Up responders), and in one third, the same genes are downregulated (Down responders), specifically in neoplastic cells. Characterization of the responder subtypes indicates subtype-specific adaptive treatment resistance mechanisms that are associated with distinct changes in the tumor microenvironment. In Up responders, recurrent tumors are enriched in quiescent proneural GBM stem cells and differentiated neoplastic cells, with increased interaction with the surrounding normal brain and neurotransmitter signaling, whereas Down responders commonly undergo mesenchymal transition. ChIP-sequencing data from longitudinal GBM tumors suggests that the observed transcriptional reprogramming could be driven by Polycomb-based chromatin remodeling rather than DNA methylation. We show that the responder subtype is cancer-cell intrinsic, recapitulated in in vitro GBM cell models, and influenced by the presence of the tumor microenvironment. Stratifying GBM tumors by responder subtype may lead to more effective treatment.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2. Study type and methodology\n3. Population characteristics\n4.

The vast majority of these biomarkers, used to discriminate between tumour types, also offered prognostic information. With the advent of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and other large genomic datasets, further prognostic sub-stratification was possible within tumour types, leading to increased precision in CNS tumour grading. This review outlines the evolution of the molecular landscape of adult CNS tumours, through the prism of World Health Organization (WHO) Classifications. We begin our journey in the pre-molecular era, where high-grade gliomas were divided into 'primary' and 'secondary' glioblastomas. Molecular alterations explaining these clinicopathological observations were the first branching points of glioma diagnostics, with the discovery of IDH1/2 mutations and 1p/19q codeletion. Subsequently, the rigorous characterisation of paediatric gliomas led to the unearthing of histone H3 alterations as a key event in gliomagenesis, which also had implications for young adult patients. Simultaneously, studies investigating prognostic biomarkers within tumour types were undertaken. Certain genomic phenotypes were found to portend unfavourable outcomes, for example, MYCN amplification in spinal ependymoma. The arrival of methylation profiling, having revolutionised the diagnosis of CNS tumours, now promises to bring increased prognostic accuracy, as has been shown in meningiomas. While MGMT promoter hypermethylation has remained a reliable biomarker of response to cytotoxic chemotherapy, targeted therapy in CNS tumours has unfortunately not had the success of other cancers. Therefore, predictive biomarkers have lagged behind the identification of prognostic biomarkers in CNS tumours. Emerging research from new clinical trials is cause for guarded optimism and may shift our conceptualisation of predictive biomarker testing in CNS tumours.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Evidence suggests that glioma stem cells (GSCs) contribute to this resistance. Mithramycin (Mit-A) targets GSCs and exhibits antitumor activity in GBM by affecting transcriptional targets such as SRY-related HMG-box transcription factor 2 (SOX2), oligodendrocyte lineage transcription factor 2 (OLIG2), and zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1). However, its clinical use has been limited by toxicity. This study explored the diagnostic potential of serum extracellular vesicles (EVs) to identify Mit-A responders. Serum EVs were isolated from 70 glioma patients, and targeted gene expression was analyzed using qRT-PCR. Using chemosensitivity assay, we identified 8 Mit-A responders and 17 nonresponders among 25 glioma patients. The M-score showed a significant correlation (<i>p</i> = 0.045) with isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 mutation but not other clinical variables. The genes SOX2 (<i>p</i> = 0.005), OLIG2 (<i>p</i> = 0.003), and ZEB1 (<i>p</i> = 0.0281) were found to be upregulated in the responder EVs. SOX2 had the highest diagnostic potential (AUC = 0.875), followed by OLIG2 (AUC = 0.772) and ZEB1 (AUC = 0.632).The combined gene panel showed significant diagnostic efficacy (AUC = 0.956) through logistic regression analysis. The gene panel was further validated in the serum EVs of 45 glioma patients. These findings highlight the potential of Mit-A as a targeted therapy for high-grade glioma based on differential gene expression in serum EVs. The gene panel could serve as a diagnostic tool to predict Mit-A sensitivity, offering a promising approach for personalized treatment strategies and emphasizing the role of GSCs in therapeutic resistance.\n\nConsider:\n1.

There are limited reports on the immune profile of these tumors. In this study, we assessed 21 PXA [15 PXA Grade 2 (PXAG2); 6 PXA Grade 3 (PXAG3)] and 14 eGB for their histopathological and molecular association. Further, their immune profile was compared with GB, IDH1 wild-type (wt) (n-18). Morphologically, PXAG2 mostly differed from eGB; however, it was occasionally difficult to differentiate PXAG3 from eGB due to their epithelioid pattern and less obvious degenerative features. PXAG2 showed predominantly diffuse, whereas variable positivity for epithelial and glial markers was seen in PXAG3 and eGB. All cases showed retained nuclear ATRX and INI-1 . H3K27M or IDH1 mutation was seen in none. P53 mutation was more common in eGB, followed by PXAG3, and least common in PXAG2. BRAF V600E mutation was observed in 66.67% PXAG2, 33.33% PXAG3, and 50% eGB, with 100% concordance between immunohistochemistry (IHC) and sequencing. Thirty-six percent eGB, 33% PXAG3, and 61% PXAG2 harbored CDKN2A homozygous deletion. EGFR amplification was observed in 14% eGB and 66% of GB, IDH wt. PDL1 and CTLA-4 expression was higher in eGB (71.4% and 57.1%), PXAG3 (66.6% and100%), and PXAG2 (60% & 66.7%) as compared with GB, IDH wt (38.8% and 16.7%). Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were also observed in a majority of eGB and PXA (90% to 100%) in contrast to GB, IDH wt (66%). This analysis highlights the homogenous molecular and immune profile of eGB and PXA, suggesting the possibility that histologically and molecularly, these two entities represent 2 ends of a continuous spectrum with PXAG3 lying in between. Higher upregulation of PDL1, CTLA-4, and increased tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in these tumors as compared with GB, IDH wt suggests potential candidature for immunotherapy.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Using glioblastoma (GBM) as a representative example of high-grade gliomas, we evaluated the clonal architecture and distribution of hotspot mutations in 388 GBMs from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Mutations were matched with 54 targeted therapies, followed by a comprehensive evaluation of drug biochemical properties in reference to the drug's clinical efficacy in high-grade gliomas. We then assessed clinical outcomes of a cohort of patients with high-grade gliomas with targetable mutations reviewed at the Johns Hopkins Molecular Tumor Board (JH MTB; <i>n</i>\u2009=\u200950). Among 1,156 sequence alterations evaluated, 28.6% represented hotspots. While the frequency of hotspot mutations in GBM was comparable to cancer types with actionable hotspot alterations, GBMs harbored a higher fraction of subclonal mutations that affected hotspots (7.0%), compared to breast cancer (4.9%), lung cancer (4.4%), and melanoma (1.4%). In investigating the biochemical features of targeted therapies paired with recurring alterations, we identified a trend toward higher lipid solubility and lower IC<sub>50</sub> in GBM cell lines among drugs with clinical efficacy. The drugs' half-life, molecular weight, surface area and binding to efflux transporters were not associated with clinical efficacy. Among the JH MTB cohort of patients with <i>IDH1</i> wild-type high-grade gliomas who received targeted therapies, trametinib monotherapy or in combination with dabrafenib conferred radiographic partial response in 75% of patients harboring <i>BRAF</i> or <i>NF1</i> actionable mutations. Cabozantinib conferred radiographic partial response in two patients harboring a <i>MET</i> and a <i>PDGFRA/KDR</i> amplification. Patients with <i>IDH1</i> wild-type gliomas that harbored actionable alterations who received genotype-matched targeted therapy had longer progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS; 7.37 and 14.72 respectively) than patients whose actionable alterations were not targeted (2.83 and 4.2\u2009months respectively). While multiple host, tumor and drug-related features may limit the delivery and efficacy of targeted therapies for patients with high-grade gliomas, genotype-matched targeted therapies confer favorable clinical outcomes. Further studies are needed to generate more data on the impact of biochemical features of targeted therapies on their clinical efficacy for high-grade gliomas.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Through prospective genomic profiling of 459 consecutive primary treatment-naïve IDH-wildtype glioblastomas in adults, we identified a unique subgroup (2%, 9/459) defined by somatic hypermutation and DNA replication repair deficiency due to biallelic inactivation of a canonical mismatch repair gene. The deleterious mutations in mismatch repair genes were often present in the germline in the heterozygous state with somatic inactivation of the remaining allele, consistent with glioblastomas arising due to underlying Lynch syndrome. A subset of tumors had accompanying proofreading domain mutations in the DNA polymerase POLE and resultant "ultrahypermutation". The median age at diagnosis was 50 years (range 27-78), compared with 63 years for the other 450 patients with conventional glioblastoma (p\u2009<\u20090.01). All tumors had histologic features of the giant cell variant of glioblastoma. They lacked EGFR amplification, lacked combined trisomy of chromosome 7 plus monosomy of chromosome 10, and only rarely had TERT promoter mutation or CDKN2A homozygous deletion, which are hallmarks of conventional IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. Instead, they harbored frequent inactivating mutations in TP53, NF1, PTEN, ATRX, and SETD2 and recurrent activating mutations in PDGFRA. DNA methylation profiling revealed they did not align with known reference adult glioblastoma methylation classes, but instead had unique globally hypomethylated epigenomes and mostly classified as "Diffuse pediatric-type high grade glioma, RTK1 subtype, subclass A". Five patients were treated with immune checkpoint blockade, four of whom survived greater than 3\xa0years.

This review summarizes the current role of molecular profiling and targeted therapies for gliomas. Molecular profiling is an integral part of the 2021 WHO classification of gliomas. Progress in the development of targeted therapies remains limited due to many factors including the presence of the blood-brain barrier and issues of tumor heterogeneity. Nonetheless, advances have been made with the IDH1/2 inhibitor vorasidenib for IDH-mutant grade 2 gliomas, the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib for BRAFV600E mutated gliomas, and the therapies for subsets of patients with fusions and H3K27M-altered diffuse midline gliomas. While there has been progress in the use of molecular profiling for the classification and treatment of gliomas, much work remains for targeted therapies to realize their potential.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Using next-generation sequencing of 812 cancer-related genes, the researchers identified key mutations in low-grade glioma (LGG) and high-grade glioma (HGG). In LGG (n = 18), IDH1/2 mutations were most common (78%), along with ATRX (33%) and TP53 (44%). In HGG (n = 113), frequent alterations included CDKN2A/B (33%), TERTp (71%), PTEN (60%), TP53 (27%), and EGFR (40%). IDH1/2 mutations were associated with better prognosis, while TERTp mutation and PTEN deletion correlated with worse survival. In IDH–wildtype glioblastoma, prior cancer history was linked to poorer outcomes, whereas re-operation and bevacizumab therapy improved overall survival. Nine patients received targeted therapies, though specific efficacy data were not detailed.

Specific TP53 mutations were identified as determinants for peptide presentation, while some mutations did not disrupt epitope presentation, suggesting potential targets for immunotherapy, including peptide-based or mRNA vaccines.\n\n2. **Methodology Overview**  \n   - Utilized in silico tools to analyze Class I MHC binding for wild-type and mutated GBM-associated proteins.  \n   - Peptide-MHC (pMHC-I) models were built using HLA-arena, followed by hierarchical clustering based on electrostatic surface features.  \n   - Conducted 100 ns molecular dynamics simulations to assess structural differences in wild-type vs. mutated peptide-MHC complexes.  \n\n3. **Population Characteristics**  \n   - Computational analysis focused on previously described immunogenic proteins in GBM, with no direct patient cohort involved.  \n\n4. **Key Statistical Results**  \n   - Identified TP53 mutations that significantly altered peptide presentation.  \n   - Selected peptides where mutations did not disrupt CD8 T cell recognition, indicating their potential as stable immunotherapeutic targets.  \n\n5. **Clinical Implications**  \n   - Findings suggest that specific GBM mutations influence immune recognition, which may impact the effectiveness of immunotherapies.  \n   - Identified peptides could serve as candidates for GBM-targeted immunotherapies, including peptide-based or mRNA vaccines.  \n   - Supports personalized treatment approaches based on tumor mutation profiles to enhance immunotherapy efficacy.  \n\nThis study provides insights into how GBM mutations affect immune targeting, which could guide the development of mutation-specific immunotherapies. However, further validation in clinical settings is needed.\n\nArticle PMID:38890658\nThis study investigated molecular subtypes of IDH1-wildtype glioblastoma (IDHwt-GBM) to improve prognosis prediction and guide personalized treatment. Using consensus clustering on multiomics data (mRNA, lncRNA, and mutations) from 184 TCGA patients, two molecular subtypes (Class 1 and Class 2) were identified and validated across five independent datasets. Class 2 was more sensitive to radiotherapy plus temozolomide, with a significant survival advantage (HR = 1.68, TCGA; validated in CGGA: HR = 1.75, CPTAC: HR = 1.79, GALSS: HR = 1.66, UCSF: HR = 1.33, UPENN: HR = 1.29). Class 2 exhibited more DNA mismatch repair defects (P = 0.0021) and alterations in ferroptosis, PD-1, and JAK-STAT pathways, suggesting differences in immune microenvironment and programmed cell death mechanisms. A machine learning-based survival prediction model integrating molecular subtypes, age, and sex demonstrated clinical utility. These findings suggest that molecular subtyping can refine treatment strategies, particularly for immunotherapy and targeted therapies, by identifying patients more likely to respond to specific interventions.\n\nArticle PMID:38404571\n### Summary: Influence of GBM Mutations on Treatment Effectiveness  \n\n#### **Main Findings & Conclusions**  \nThis study examined the prognostic significance of MGMT methylation, TERT promoter (pTERT) mutation, and immune checkpoint markers (CD47 and TIGIT) in adult diffuse gliomas (ADG), including glioblastoma (GBM). Key findings include:  \n- **MGMT unmethylation** was associated with poor overall survival (OS).  \n- **High CD47 and TIGIT expression** correlated with significantly worse prognosis in ADG and GBM.  \n- **CD47 and TIGIT were overexpressed in GBM tissues** compared to normal brain tissue.  \n- Patients with high CD47/TIGIT expression may benefit from **anti-CD47 and TIGIT immunotherapy**.  \n\n#### **Methodology Overview**  \n- **Tumor Classification:** Used the 2021 WHO system to categorize ADG into astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, and GBM.  \n- **Biomarker Analysis:** Immunohistochemistry assessed CD47 and TIGIT expression in tumor vs. normal tissues.  \n- **Survival Analysis:** Correlated MGMT methylation, pTERT mutation, and immune markers with OS.  \n\n#### **Population Characteristics**  \n- Included patients diagnosed with **astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, and GBM**.  \n- Tumor samples analyzed for **MGMT methylation, pTERT mutation, and immune marker expression**.  \n\n#### **Key Statistical Results**  \n- **MGMT unmethylation** was significantly associated with **reduced OS** in astrocytoma (p < 0.05).  \n- **High CD47, TIGIT, and CD47/TIGIT expression** correlated with **worse survival in ADG and GBM** (p < 0.01).  \n- **MGMT unmethylation and high CD47 expression** were independent **negative prognostic factors** for OS.  \n\n#### **Clinical Implications**  \n- **MGMT unmethylation predicts poor response to temozolomide (TMZ)**, reinforcing the need for alternative treatments.  \n- **High CD47/TIGIT expression suggests potential benefit from CD47 and TIGIT-targeted immunotherapies**.  \n- Findings support **integrating immunotherapy into GBM treatment strategies**, particularly for patients with high CD47/TIGIT\n\nProvide a comprehensive synthesis that:\n1.

We analyzed the frequency of PD-L1 expression in glioma samples. Methodology In this two-year retrospective study, 45 glioma cases of varying grades (grades 2 to 4) were examined at a tertiary care hospital. Tumor samples that were formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) were obtained from the pathology archives of the hospital. According to the WHO Classification of Central Nervous System Tumors, 5th edition, tumor grading and histopathological subtyping were carried out. PD-L1 antibody (clone 28-8) and IDH1 (R132H, clone QM002, Quartett Immunodiagnostika, 1:100 dilution) markers were used for immunohistochemistry (IHC). The sections underwent deparaffinization, rehydration, and antigen retrieval using Leica bond III staining platform. Based on the tumor proportion score (TPS), which is the proportion of viable tumor cells with membranous staining, PD-L1 expression was assessed. The literature's standardized cut-off values were used to determine positive expression. Staining intensity and tumor cell location were used to determine the status of IDH1 mutations. Age, sex, and tumor location were among the clinical and demographic information gathered about the patient. The association between PD-L1 expression, glioma grades, and IDH1 (R132H) mutation status was assessed statistically using SPSS software and a Chi-square test. The threshold for statistical significance was p < 0.05. For every IHC run, positive and negative controls were used as part of the quality control procedures. To reduce bias and guarantee consistency, two pathologists and post graduate residents independently reviewed the results. Results PD-L1 expression was found in 27 out of 36 (75%) grade 4 glioblastoma multiforme cases and six out of nine (66.7%) grade 2 gliomas. Overall, 33/45 (73.3%) of the gliomas had PD-L1 expression. However, PD-L1 expression and glioma grade did not correlate in a statistically significant way. IDH1 (R132H) expression and PD-L1 were found to be inversely correlated (p < 0.05). Conclusion The findings suggest that PD-L1 may be a promising therapeutic target, even in the absence of significant grade-specific trends by\xa0demonstrating PD-L1 presence in the majority of glioma cases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in GBM immunotherapy. The results provide insight into the immune landscape of gliomas and pave the way for future research into effective combination therapies for GBM, despite the lack of a significant correlation between glioma grade and PD-L1 expression.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Here, we characterized 5 murine GBM stem-like cell (mGSC) models derived from lentivirus-induced tumors in transgenic mice that are driven by the activation of the Nf1-Ras signaling pathway and inactivation of Tp53. MGSC lines (005, RIG, NF53, C1, and C3) were cultured as spheres in serum-free stem cell media. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was employed to quantify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Stem cell properties were characterized by stemness in vitro and tumorigenicity after intracerebral implantation in C57BL/6 mice. Tumor phenotypes and the immune microenvironment were characterized by immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and RNA sequencing. WES revealed a large variation in coding sequence SNPs across mGSC lines (~20-fold), likely influenced by the mixed backgrounds of the parental mice. MGSCs exhibited variable clonogenic sphere formation and CD133 expression levels. In vivo, they consistently initiated lethal malignant gliomas, with median survival ranging from 29 to 82 days, and showed strong CD44 expression and variable invasiveness. The tumor microenvironment featured an abundance of CD68+ macrophages and uniform high PD-L1+ myeloid cells, while T-cell infiltration varied among the models, with low mutation burden C1 and C3 exhibiting fewer tumor-infiltrating T cells. Upon orthotopic implantation in immunocompetent mice, mGSCs generate tumors characteristic of human GBM. Despite similar strategies to generate these mGSCs, they exhibited a range of phenotypes and immune profiles in mGSC-derived orthotopic tumors. These mGSCs provide new preclinical GBM models for developing GBM immunotherapies.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2. Study type and methodology\n3. Population characteristics\n4.

Non-canonical mutations such as BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>, found in 1-2% of GBMs, activate the MEK-ERK signaling pathway. This mutation can be targeted by small molecule inhibitors, offering therapeutic potential for GBM. In this case report, we describe the management of a 67-year-old male with BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> -mutant GBM, who experienced both local clonal and distant non-clonal BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> -mutant recurrences. Initial treatment involved surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and temozolomide (TMZ). Subsequent recurrences were managed with re-resection and dabrafenib/trametinib combination therapy. Notably, a new, non-clonal BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> -negative tumor developed in a distant location, highlighting the challenge of clonal evolution and resistance in GBM management. The patient's disease ultimately progressed despite multiple lines of therapy, including targeted inhibition. Identifying mechanisms of resistance and tailoring flexible treatment approaches are essential for advancing outcomes in BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> -mutant GBM. This case emphasizes the value of molecular profiling in personalizing treatment for patients with multifocal disease. The evolving nature of these tumors requires persistent clinical monitoring and treatment adjustments based on tissue diagnostics.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

In the following 20 years, it has lived up to expectations. A substantial body of evidence has demonstrated that it is closely related to the development, metastasis, migration, and drug resistance of malignant tumors. In recent years, research on the MSI protein has advanced, and many novel viewpoints and drug resistance attempts have been derived; for example, tumor protein p53 mutations and MSI-binding proteins lead to resistance to protein arginine N-methyltransferase 5-targeted therapy in lymphoma patients. Moreover, the high expression of MSI2 in pancreatic cancer might suppress its development and progression. As a significant member of the MSI family, MSI2 is closely associated with multiple malignant tumors, including hematological disorders, common abdominal tumors, and other tumor types (e.g., glioblastoma, breast cancer). MSI2 is highly expressed in the majority of tumors and is related to a poor disease prognosis. However, its specific expression levels and regulatory mechanisms may differ based on the tumor type. This review summarizes the research progress related to MSI2 in recent years, including its occurrence, migration mechanism, and drug resistance, as well as the prospect of developing tumor immunosuppressants and biomarkers.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Although the survival is generally dismal for glioblastoma patients, risk stratification and the identification of high-risk subgroups is important for prompt and aggressive management. The G1-G7 molecular subgroup classification based on the MAPK pathway activation has offered for the first time a non-redundant, all-inclusive classification of adult glioblastoma. Five patients from the large, 218-patient, prospective cohort showed germline mutations in mismatch repair (MMR) genes (Lynch syndrome) and a significantly worse median survival of 3.25 months post-surgery than those from the G1/EGFR and G3/NF1 major subgroups, or from the rest of the cohort adjusted for age. These rare tumors were assigned to a new subgroup, G3/MMR, a G3/NF1 subgroup spin-off, as they generally show genomic alterations leading to RAS activation, such as <i>NF1</i> and <i>PTPN11</i> mutations. An integrated clinical, histologic and molecular analysis of the G3/MMR tumors showed distinct characteristics as compared to other glioblastomas, including those with iatrogenic high tumor mutation burden (TMB), warranting a separate subgroup. Prior history of cancer, midline location or multifocality, presence of multinucleated giant cells (MGCs), positive p53 and MMR immunohistochemistry, and specific molecular characteristics, including high TMB, <i>MSH2</i>/<i>MSH6</i> alterations, biallelic <i>TP53</i> Arg mutations and co-occurring <i>PIK3CA</i> p.R88Q and <i>PTEN</i> alterations, alert to this high-risk G3/MMR subgroup. The MGCs and p53 immunohistochemistry analysis in G1-G7 subgroups showed that one in 7 tumors with these characteristics is a G3/MMR glioblastoma. The FDA-approved first-line therapy for many advanced solid tumors consists of nivolumab-ipilimumab immune checkpoint inhibitors. One G3/MMR patient received this regimen and survived much longer than the rest, setting a proof-of-principle example for the treatment of these very aggressive G3/MMR glioblastomas.\n\nConsider:\n1.

The HGG patients following surgery and treatment with radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses were used to assess the independent prognostic factors. The nomogram model was established, and its accuracy was determined via the calibration plots. A total of 215 and 88 patients had grade III glioma and grade IV glioma, respectively. Grade III oligodendroglioma (OG-G3) patients had the longest mPFS and mOS than other grade III pathology, while grade III astrocytoma (AA-G3) patients were close to IDH-1 wildtype glioblastoma (GBM) and had a poor prognosis. The IDH-1 mutant group had a better mPFS and mOS than the IDH-1 wildtype group in all grade III patients, OG-G3 and AA-G3 patients. Furthermore, 1p/19q co-deletion group had a longer mPFS and mOS than 1p/19q non-deletion group in all grade III patients. IDH-1 mutation and 1p/19q co-deletion patients had the best prognosis than other molecular types. Also, the MGMT methylation and IDH-1 mutation or 1p/19q co-deletion group had a longer mPFS and mOS than the MGMT unmethylation and IDH-1 wildtype or 1p/19q non-codeletion of grade III patients. In addition, the low Ki-67 expression group had a better prognosis than high Ki-67 expression group in grade III patients. Univariate and multivariate COX showed that 1p/19q co-deletion and MGMT methylation were the independent prognostic factors for mPFS and mOS. The calibration curve showed that the established nomogram could well predict the survival based on these covariates. The AA-G3 with IDH-1 wildtype, MGMT unmethylation or 1p/19q non-codeletion patients was resistant to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, has a poor prognosis and needs a more active treatment.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Disruption of the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway in tumor cells enhances the effectiveness of radiotherapy drugs, while increased mutational burden following tumor cell damage also facilitates the efficacy of immunotherapy. The ATRX gene, located on chromosome X, plays a crucial role in DDR. The aim of this research is to elucidate the correlation between ATRX mutations and GBM. Dataset obtained from TCGA-GBM were conducted an analysis on the genomic features, biological characteristics, immunopathological markers, and clinical prognosis of patients carrying ATRX mutations. Our findings revealed a significantly elevated level of microsatellite instability in individuals with ATRX mutants, along with significant alterations in the receptor-tyrosine kinase (RTK)-ras pathway among patients exhibiting combined ATRX mutations. TCGA-GBM patients with concurrent ATRX mutations exhibited sensitivity to 26 chemotherapeutic and anticancer drugs, which exerted their effects by modulating the DDR of tumor cells through highly correlated mechanisms involving the RTK-ras pathway. Additionally, we observed an enrichment of ATRX mutations in specific pathways associated with DDR among TCGA-GBM patients. Our model also demonstrated prolonged overall survival in patients carrying ATRX mutations, particularly showing strong predictive value for 3- and 5-year survival rates. Furthermore, additional protective factors such as younger age, female gender, combined IDH mutations, and TP53 mutations were identified. The results underscore the protective role and prognostic significance of ATRX mutations in GBM as a potential therapeutic target and biomarker for patient survival.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Aberrant expression of RNF7 has been observed in various tumor types and is known to significantly influence tumor initiation and progression. However, the specific role of RNF7 in glioblastoma remains unclear. IDH (isocitrate dehydrogenase) mutations, which induce metabolic reprogramming and result in notable heterogeneity among glioma with different IDH genotypes. Through analysis of public glioma databases, we identified a high expression of RNF7 in glioma and its correlation with patient prognosis. Moreover, we observed variations in RNF7 expression and its association with patient outcomes under different treatment modalities among different IDH genotypes. In this study, we demonstrated the critical role of RNF7 in the malignant phenotype of IDH1-mutant glioma and its contribution to radiation resistance. Subsequent functional enrichment analysis of RNF7 in glioma, coupled with validation through cellular experiments, confirmed its significant involvement in maintaining redox balance. Our findings suggest that RNF7 exerts a buffering effect against radiation-induced oxidative stress and counterbalances the redox stress induced by IDH1 mutation through its anti-ROS activity. Additionally, our follow-up investigations revealed that the upregulation of RNF7 after radiation exposure and in IDH1-mutant glioma cells is induced by ROS. Collectively, our study underscores the potential of RNF7 as a molecular biomarker in glioma. Elevated RNF7 expression often indicates a heightened metabolic resilience in glioma, leading to resistance against radiotherapy.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

To explore the relationship between MRI perfusion metrics (rCBV, rCBF), genetic markers, and contrast enhancement patterns in gliomas, aiming to enhance diagnostic accuracy and inform personalized therapeutic strategies. Additionally, other radiological features, such as the T2/FLAIR mismatch sign, are evaluated for their predictive utility in IDH mutations. Retrospective cohort study. 67 patients with brain tumors (including glioblastoma, astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma) undergoing surgical resection. 1.5 Tesla MRI, including T1 pre- and post-contrast, FLAIR, DWI, and DSC sequences. Semiquantitative perfusion metrics (rCBV, rCBF) were evaluated against genetic markers (IDH1, EGFR, CDKN2A, PDGFRA, MGMT, TERT, 1p19q, PTEN, TP53, H3F3A) through advanced MRI techniques. Contrast enhancement was assessed, and genetic alterations were confirmed via histopathological and molecular analyses. Chi-square test, sensitivity, specificity, and ROC analysis for predictive modeling; significance level set at p\xa0<\xa00.05. Statistically significant differences in perfusion metrics were observed among tumors with distinct genetic profiles, with primary tumors and those harboring specific mutations (IDH1 wildtype, EGFR amplification, CDKN2A homozygous deletion, PDGFRA amplification) showing higher perfusion values. A cut-off value of <4 for rCBV in predicting IDH1 mutation yielded a sensitivity of 61.5\xa0% and specificity of 82.1\xa0%. For CDKN2A deletion, a cut-off of >5 resulted in a sensitivity of 75\xa0% and specificity of 74.6\xa0%, with an ROC value of 0.78. Integrating perfusion MRI with genetic analysis offers a promising approach to improving the diagnostic and therapeutic landscape for brain tumors, indicating a substantial step toward personalized neuro-oncology. Additionally, findings like the T2/FLAIR mismatch sign highlight the potential for preoperative molecular predictions when biopsy is not feasible. These findings support further validation in larger, multi-institutional studies to solidify their role in clinical practice.

Personalized treatment based on molecular markers may help improve the prognosis. We aimed to evaluate whether apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) histogram analysis can better predict MGMT and TERT molecular characteristics and to determine the prognostic relevance of genetic profile in patients with GBM. MRI, clinical, and pathological data of 79 patients with GBM were retrospectively collected. The ADC values based on histogram analysis were described using 10th percentile (p10), 90th percentile (p90), mean, median, minimum, maximum, skewness, kurtosis, and entropy. The independent-sample t test, linear correlation analysis, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and Cox proportional hazard regression were performed. MGMT promoter methylation and TERT promoter mutation were detected in 53.2% and 44.3% of GBM patients, respectively. The ADC<sub>p10</sub> in MGMT promoter unmethylated group was significantly lower than that in the MGMT promoter methylated group (p\xa0=\xa00.005). There were significant differences in ADC<sub>min</sub>, ADC<sub>p10</sub>, ADC<sub>mean</sub>, and entropy between TERT promoter mutant and wild-type groups. Entropy showed the best diagnostic performance in differentiating between positive and negative TERT groups (AUC\xa0=\xa00.722, p\xa0=\xa00.001). Overall survival (OS) showed a positive correlation with ADC<sub>min</sub>. The TERT promoter mutation was the only independent prognostic factor for GBM. ADC histogram analysis may be a potential noninvasive biomarker for differentiating MGMT and TERT molecular markers and providing prognostic information for GBM patients.\n\nConsider:\n1.

The molecular profile of adult PLG has not been well-characterized. We report the clinical, pathological, and molecular findings of six adult PLG patients (five males and one female), median age 58\u2009years. All cases exhibited pathological leptomeningeal enhancement at presentation. Leptomeningeal biopsy was diagnostic in five (of six) cases, revealing infiltration by an astrocytic glioma with mitotic activity, lacking microvascular proliferation or necrosis. One case was diagnosed at autopsy. All tumors were IDH-wildtype, with five harboring TERT promoter mutations. Additional mutations identified were PTEN in one case, TP53 in two cases, and NF1 in two cases. A chromosome profile with +7/-10 was found in four cases, whereas the remaining two showed either chromosome 7 or 7p gain only. Four cases showed chromosome 9p loss with CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion, one case showed hemizygous CDKN2A/B loss, and one case showed intact chromosome 9 and CDK4/GLI1 amplification. DNA methylation profiling was performed in four cases and revealed a match to glioblastoma (GBM) family and mesenchymal typical class with high confidence scores in two cases; the other two cases showed only suggestive combined scores for GBM family and mesenchymal atypical class. The molecular profile of all cases closely aligned with that of adult-type GBM, IDH-wildtype, CNS WHO grade 4. All patients succumbed to the disease. In five cases with extensive leptomeningeal disease at diagnosis, the course was rapid, with median survival of 24\u2009days following palliative care. Only one case, with relatively localized disease at diagnosis, received chemoradiation therapy and survived 535\u2009days, raising the possibility that early diagnosis and timely treatment could improve outcome. A detailed list of previously reported cases is provided in a supplementary table.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2. Study type and methodology\n3. Population characteristics\n4.

Although TP53 mutations are prevalent in glioblastoma (GBM), the mechanisms by which TP53 regulates iron metabolism remain elusive. We reveal an imbalance iron homeostasis in GBM via TCGA database analysis. TP53 mutations disrupted iron homeostasis in GBM, characterized by elevated total iron levels and reduced ferritin (FTH). The gain-of-function effect triggered by TP53 mutations upregulates itchy E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (ITCH) protein expression in astrocytes, leading to FTH degradation and an increase in free iron levels. TP53-mut astrocytes were more tolerant to the high iron environment induced by exogenous ferric ammonium citrate (FAC), but the increase in intracellular free iron made them more sensitive to Erastin-induced ferroptosis. Interestingly, we found that Erastin combined with FAC treatment significantly increased ferroptosis. These findings provide new insights for drug development and therapeutic modalities for GBM patients with TP53 mutations from iron metabolism perspectives.\n\nConsider:\n1.

While some studies suggest a survival advantage for gcGB patients, the underlying causes remain elusive. GcGBs are associated with TP53 mutations, and gcs were shown to accumulate DNA double-strand breaks and show deficient mitosis, potentially triggering cellular senescence programs. Epigenetic clocks have emerged as valuable tools for assessing tumor-induced age acceleration (DNAMethAgeAcc), which has lately proved itself as prognostic biomarker in glioblastoma. Our study aimed to comprehensively analyze the methylome and key metabolic proteins of gcGBs, hypothesizing that they undergo cellular aging programs compared to non-gcGBs. A total of 310 epigenetically classified GBs, including 26 gcGBs, and nine adults with malignant gliomas allocating to pediatric high-grade glioma molecular subclasses (summarized as "pediatric GB") were included. DNAMethAgeAcc was computed by subtraction of chronological patient ages from DNA methylome-derived age estimations and its increase was associated with better survival within gcGB and non-gcGB. GcGBs were significantly more often allocated to the subgroup with increased DNAMethAgeAcc and demonstrated the highest DNAMethAgeAcc. Hypothetical senescence/aging-induced changes of the tumor microenvironment were addressed by tumor deconvolution, which was able to identify a cluster enriched for tumors with increased DNAMethAgeAcc. Key metabolic protein expression did not differ between gcGB and non-gcGB and tumor with versus without increased DNAMethAgeAcc but for elevated levels of one single mitochondrial marker, anti-mitochondrial protein MT-C02, in gcGBs. With its sped-up epigenetic aging, gcGB presented as the epigenetic oldest GB variant in our cohort. Whereas the correlation between accelerated tumor-intrinsic epigenetic aging and cellular senescence in gcGB stays elusive, fostering epigenetic aging programs in GB might be of interest for future exploration of alternative treatment options in GB patients.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Using gene editing protocol based on CRISPR-Cas 9 with cytidine deaminase, we introduced point mutations into U87MG glioblastoma cells to establish modified cell lines with heterozygous IDH1 R132H, homozygous TP53 R248Q and heterozygous IDH1 R132H, homozygous TP53 R248Q genotypes. A comparative study of cell migration on major ECM components was carried out by high-content microscopy. IDH1 R132H mutation introduced to U87MG glioblastoma cells was shown to decrease the migration speed on Matrigel and collagen IV substrates compared to the wild-type. This data were supported by cell adhesion quantification via the lateral shift assay performed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). TP53 R248Q mutation increased cell adhesion to various substrates and significantly promoted cell migration on hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate but did not change the migration rates on laminin and collagens IV and I. A double-mutant genotype produced by consequently introducing IDH1 R132H and TP53 R248Q to parental glioblastoma cells was characterized by the highest migration among all the cell lines, with particularly faster motility on chondroitin sulfate. These findings underscore the complex interactions between glioma cells, with the most important driver mutations and specific ECM components regulating cancer cell migration, offering valuable insights for potential therapeutic targets in glioma treatment.\n\nConsider:\n1.

This subtype is associated with significant heterogeneity, chemoresistance, early recurrence, metastasis, and poor patient survival. FOXM1 is a cancer-promoting transcription factor that plays a critical role in TNBC and other highly aggressive cancers by driving cell proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance. In TNBC, mutations in the TP53 gene-detected in approximately 80% of patients-lead to the overexpression of FOXM1, making it a promising therapeutic target. Beyond TNBC, FOXM1 is implicated in other solid cancers, such as brain (glioblastoma), lung, and pancreatic cancers, and is considered an Achilles' heel of aggressive cancers. Despite its potential as a therapeutic target, there are currently no FDA-approved FOXM1 inhibitors, and none have advanced to clinical trials. This review explores the role of FOXM1 in cancer progression and highlights the current status of efforts to develop effective FOXM1 inhibitors.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from GBM cells contain important biomarkers, such as microRNAs, proteins, and DNA mutations, which are involved in tumor progression, invasion, and resistance to treatment. Identifying surface markers on these EVs is crucial for their isolation and potential use in noninvasive diagnosis. This study aimed to use tumor-derived explants to investigate the surface markers of EVs and explore their role as diagnostic biomarkers for GBM. Tumor explants from nine GBM patients without IDH1/IDH2 mutations or 1p-19q co-deletion were cultured to preserve both tumor viability and cytoarchitecture. EVs were collected from the tumor microenvironment using differential centrifugation, filtration, and membrane affinity binding. Their surface protein composition was analyzed through multiplex protein assays. RNA-Seq data from TCGA and GTEx datasets, along with in silico single-cell RNA-seq data, were used to assess EV surface biomarker expression across large GBM patient cohorts. The in vitro model successfully replicated the tumor microenvironment and produced EVs with distinct surface markers. Biomarker analysis in large datasets revealed specific expression patterns unique to GBM patients compared with healthy controls. These markers demonstrated potential as a GBM-specific signature and were correlated with clinical data. Furthermore, in silico single-cell RNA-seq provided detailed insights into biomarker distribution across different cell types within the tumor. This study underscores the efficacy of the tumor-derived explant model and its potential to advance the understanding of GBM biology and EV production. A key innovation is the isolation of EVs from a model that faithfully mimics the tumor's original cytoarchitecture, offering a deeper understanding of the cells involved in EV release. The identified EV surface markers represent promising targets for enhancing EV isolation and optimizing their use as diagnostic tools. Moreover, further investigation into their molecular cargo may provide crucial insights into tumor characteristics and evolution.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

Approximately 8% of GBM cases exhibit genomic alterations in fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs), particularly FGFR1 and FGFR3. Next-generation sequencing techniques have identified various FGFR3 fusions in GBM. This report presents a novel FGFR3 fusion with fatty acid synthase (FASN) in a 41-year-old male diagnosed with GBM. The patient presented with a persistent headache, and imaging revealed a right frontal lobe lesion. Surgical resection and subsequent histopathology confirmed GBM. Initial NGS analysis showed no mutations in the IDH1, IDH2 or H3F3 genes, but revealed a TERT promoter mutation and CDKN2A/2B and PTEN deletions. Postoperative treatment included radiotherapy and temozolomide. Despite initial management, recurrence occurred four months post-diagnosis, confirmed by MRI and histology. A second surgery identified a novel FGFR3-FASN fusion, alongside increased Ki67 expression. The recurrence was managed with regorafenib and bevacizumab, though complications like hand-foot syndrome and radiation necrosis arose. Despite initial improvement, the patient died 15 months after diagnosis. This case underscores the importance of understanding GBM's molecular landscape for effective treatment strategies. The novel FGFR3-FASN fusion suggests potential implications for GBM recurrence and lipid metabolism. Further studies are warranted to explore FGFR3-FASN's role in GBM and its therapeutic targeting.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2. Study type and methodology\n3.

Despite current therapies, the 5-year survival rate is 5%-10%. The authors report a case with a durable long-term response to immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibition in a patient with LFS-associated GBM. An 18-year-old female presented after a syncopal episode and left leg weakness and was found to have a right frontal tumor. She underwent gross-total resection of the tumor (grade IV giant cell GBM IDH-wildtype, MGMT unmethylated, associated with a p53 germline mutation), radiation, and chemotherapy. On later imaging, increased enhancement was demonstrated, which raised concerns for tumor recurrence, and she underwent stereotactic radiosurgery followed by lomustine and procarbazine. These agents were later replaced with bevacizumab after a second resection, negative for recurrent glioma. Subsequently, nivolumab was added, given concerns for tumor progression, and the patient showed improvement within 5 months. The patient has continued nivolumab monotherapy and has had progression-free survival for more than 7 years. Despite advances in treatment, the median survival of patients with GBM is only 15 months. This case highlights the potential of immunotherapy with PD-L1 checkpoint inhibition in improving outcomes for LFS-associated GBM patients. https://thejns.org/doi/10.3171/CASE24539.\n\nConsider:\n1.

With the aim of facilitating the discrimination of glioblastoma molecular phenotypes and improving the accuracy of molecular imaging diagnosis, the present retrospective study analyzed the association between <i>MGMT</i> promoter methylation and glioblastoma magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) texture features and prognosis. A total of 128 patients with pathologically diagnosed glioblastoma who had undergone preoperative MRI were enrolled. MRI texture features were extracted using 3D Slicer software and their relationship with <i>MGMT</i> promoter methylation was evaluated. In total, seven MRI texture features were significantly different between glioblastomas with methylated and unmethylated <i>MGMT</i> promoters-energy, entropy, uniformity, autocorrelation, and variance in gray level co-occurrence matrix, gray level non-uniformity and cluster shade. Glioblastomas with methylated and unmethylated <i>MGMT</i> promoters differed in tumor location, with the former predominantly located in the temporal lobe [Model I, area under the curve (AUC): 0.697]. Among MRI texture features, variance was significantly different between methylation groups (Model II, AUC: 0.838). Significant overall survival (OS) differences were noticed between patients with methylated and unmethylated <i>MGMT</i> promoters, between patients with preoperative Karnofsky performance status (KPS) scores ≥80 and <80, and among patients with glioblastoma who received radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or concurrent chemoradiotherapy. The seven MRI texture features may serve as independent predictors of prognosis for patients with glioblastoma with methylated <i>MGMT</i> promoters. MRI texture features demonstrated improved and more accurate diagnostic performance than MRI features regarding <i>MGMT</i> promoter methylation status prediction. For patients with glioblastoma with preoperative KPS scores ≥80, those with methylated <i>MGMT</i> promoters had significantly longer OS. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy had a significantly improved prognosis than either radiotherapy or chemotherapy alone. In summary, the present study provided a non-invasive, cost-effective method for detecting <i>MGMT</i> promoter methylation and can significantly contribute to personalized treatment planning for patients with glioblastoma, potentially improving their quality of life.\n\nConsider:\n1.

ALDH1A1 is a primary metabolic enzyme impacting the outcome of chemotherapy, including temozolomide. High expression of ALDH1A1 is associated with poor prognosis in multiple cancers, suggesting PPIs may have a negative impact on survival. Real-world data on GBM patients was annotated from electronic medical records (EMR) according to the prospective observational study, XCELSIOR (NCT03793088). Patients with known <i>IDH1/2</i> mutations were excluded. Causal effects on survival were analyzed using a multivariate, time-varying Cox Proportional Hazard (CPH) model with stratifications including <i>MGMT</i> methylation status, age, sex, duration of corticosteroid use, extent of resection, starting standard-of-care, and PPI use. EMR data from 554 GBM patients across 225 cancer centers was collected, with 72% of patients receiving care from academic medical centers. Patients treated with PPIs (51%) had numerically lower median overall survival (mOS) and 2-year OS rates in the total population and across most strata, with the greatest difference for MGMT-methylated patients (mOS 29.2 vs. 40.1 months). In a time-varying multivariate CPH analysis of the above strata, PPIs caused an adverse effect on survival (HR 1.67 [95% CI: 1.15-2.44], <i>P</i>\u2005=\u2005.007). Evidence from a nationwide cancer registry has suggested PPIs have a negative impact on OS for GBM patients, particularly those with <i>MGMT</i> promoter methylation. This suggests PPIs should be avoided for prophylactic management of gastrointestinal toxicity in patients with GBM receiving chemoradiotherapy.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

In a retrospective single-center study the results of sPDT with 5-ALA in 10 patients (6 of 10 were male), aged 30 to 62 years (median: 51.5 years; 95% CI: 38-59 years) with recurrent malignant brain gliomas after standard therapy who underwent surgery during the period of 2020-2023 were analyzed. sPDT was conducted during 15 min using 5-ALA at a dosage of 20 mg/kg, a diode laser with a wavelength of 635 nm and power of 1 W, and the LFT-02-BIOSPEC unit (BIOSPEC, Russia). Three patients got repeated sPDT after 3, 7, and 15 months due to a relapse. The number of target points and the optimal position for intervention paths were determined according to the data of preoperative stereotactic MRI of the brain with contrast intensification using the CRW Precision stereotactic navigation system (Integra, USA) and intraoperative registration of the area with the highest intensity of protoporphyrin IX fluorescence along the path (according to fluorescence biospectroscopy). Glioblastoma (grade IV, WHO) was diagnosed in 7 patients, anaplastic astrocytoma (grade III, WHO) - in 3 persons. Genetic studies were performed for 9 patients, 7 of them had tumors without the <i>IDH1</i> gene mutation. None of the patients had a combined 1p/19q deletion. The median volume of the contrast-enhancing part of the recurrent tumor was 7.95 cm<sup>3</sup> (95% CI: 3.3-13.6 cm<sup>3</sup>). The median time to relapse after sPDT in patients with anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas was 14.5 and 6.5 months, respectively. The median survival time after sPDT in patients with glioblastomas was 15.8 months (95% CI: 0.5-20.1 months), and in patients with anaplastic astrocytomas - 46.3 months (95%, CI not specified). In the early postoperative period, two patients had motor aphasia and hemiparesis, which further regressed. The results of a small group of patients allow to consider sPDT with 5-ALA as a promising technique to treat patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas in functionally relevant brain areas and require further prospective assessment.\n\nConsider:\n1.

High levels of EGFR expression and mutations have been found in many GB patients, making the EGFR an attractive target for therapeutic treatment. The EGFRvIII mutant is the most studied, it is not found in normal cells and is positively associated with tumor cell aggressiveness and poor patient prognosis, not to mention there is a possibility of it being a tumor stem cell marker. Some anti-EGFR DNA aptamers have already been selected, including the aptamer U2. The goal of this study was to construct a more stable derivative of the aptamer U2, while not ruining its functional potential toward cell cultures from GB patients. A multiloop motif in a putative secondary structure of the aptamer U2 was taken as a key feature to design a novel minimal aptamer, Gol1, using molecular dynamics simulations for predicted 3D models. It turned out that the aptamer Gol1 has a similar putative secondary structure, with G-C base pairs providing its stability. The anti-proliferative activities of the aptamer Gol1 were assessed using patient-derived GB continuous cell cultures, G01 and BU881, with different abundances of EGFR and EGFRvIII. The transcriptome data for the cell culture G01, after aptamer Gol1 treatment, revealed significant changes in gene expression; it induced the transcription of genes associated with neurogenesis and cell differentiation, and it decreased the transcription of genes mediating key nuclear processes. There were significant changes in the gene transcription of key pro-oncogenic signaling pathways mediated by the EGFR. Therefore, the aptamer Gol1 could potentially be an efficient molecule for translation into biomedicine, in order to develop targeted therapy for GB patients.\n\nConsider:\n1.

We analyzed the frequency of PD-L1 expression in glioma samples. Methodology In this two-year retrospective study, 45 glioma cases of varying grades (grades 2 to 4) were examined at a tertiary care hospital. Tumor samples that were formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) were obtained from the pathology archives of the hospital. According to the WHO Classification of Central Nervous System Tumors, 5th edition, tumor grading and histopathological subtyping were carried out. PD-L1 antibody (clone 28-8) and IDH1 (R132H, clone QM002, Quartett Immunodiagnostika, 1:100 dilution) markers were used for immunohistochemistry (IHC). The sections underwent deparaffinization, rehydration, and antigen retrieval using Leica bond III staining platform. Based on the tumor proportion score (TPS), which is the proportion of viable tumor cells with membranous staining, PD-L1 expression was assessed. The literature's standardized cut-off values were used to determine positive expression. Staining intensity and tumor cell location were used to determine the status of IDH1 mutations. Age, sex, and tumor location were among the clinical and demographic information gathered about the patient. The association between PD-L1 expression, glioma grades, and IDH1 (R132H) mutation status was assessed statistically using SPSS software and a Chi-square test. The threshold for statistical significance was p < 0.05. For every IHC run, positive and negative controls were used as part of the quality control procedures. To reduce bias and guarantee consistency, two pathologists and post graduate residents independently reviewed the results. Results PD-L1 expression was found in 27 out of 36 (75%) grade 4 glioblastoma multiforme cases and six out of nine (66.7%) grade 2 gliomas. Overall, 33/45 (73.3%) of the gliomas had PD-L1 expression. However, PD-L1 expression and glioma grade did not correlate in a statistically significant way. IDH1 (R132H) expression and PD-L1 were found to be inversely correlated (p < 0.05). Conclusion The findings suggest that PD-L1 may be a promising therapeutic target, even in the absence of significant grade-specific trends by\xa0demonstrating PD-L1 presence in the majority of glioma cases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in GBM immunotherapy. The results provide insight into the immune landscape of gliomas and pave the way for future research into effective combination therapies for GBM, despite the lack of a significant correlation between glioma grade and PD-L1 expression.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Non-canonical mutations such as BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>, found in 1-2% of GBMs, activate the MEK-ERK signaling pathway. This mutation can be targeted by small molecule inhibitors, offering therapeutic potential for GBM. In this case report, we describe the management of a 67-year-old male with BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> -mutant GBM, who experienced both local clonal and distant non-clonal BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> -mutant recurrences. Initial treatment involved surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and temozolomide (TMZ). Subsequent recurrences were managed with re-resection and dabrafenib/trametinib combination therapy. Notably, a new, non-clonal BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> -negative tumor developed in a distant location, highlighting the challenge of clonal evolution and resistance in GBM management. The patient's disease ultimately progressed despite multiple lines of therapy, including targeted inhibition. Identifying mechanisms of resistance and tailoring flexible treatment approaches are essential for advancing outcomes in BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> -mutant GBM. This case emphasizes the value of molecular profiling in personalizing treatment for patients with multifocal disease. The evolving nature of these tumors requires persistent clinical monitoring and treatment adjustments based on tissue diagnostics.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors show promise in cancer therapy, yet their efficacy in glioblastomas, particularly with IDH1 mutations, remains unclear. This study analyzed two independent NGS datasets (n = 577 and n = 153) from TCGA to investigate the expression of PDCD1 and CD274 in glioblastomas and their relationship with IDH1 mutations. We used cBioPortal for mutation analysis, RNA seq for expression analysis, miRDB and miRabel for differential expression of miRNAs, and Kaplan-Meier for survival prediction. We found that 5.4% of glioblastomas harbored IDH1 mutations, correlating with improved overall survival (OS) (p = 2.196e-3). Different glioblastoma cohorts showed a diverse IDH1 mutational prevalence (4-31%). Despite this, IDH1<sup>Mu</sup> was consistently associated with better OS (p = 8.235e-5). Notably, PDCD1 and CD274 were statistically significantly highly expressed in both IDH1<sup>Wt</sup> (p < 0.0001) and IDH1<sup>Mu</sup> tumors (p < 0.0001), with higher expression linked to poorer survival outcomes (PDCD1: p = 0.009; CD274: p = 0.02). Differential co-expression analyses revealed distinct gene and miRNA profiles for IDH1<sup>Wt</sup> and IDH1<sup>Mu</sup> glioblastomas, with specific upregulation of PTEN and downregulation of MUC16 in IDH1<sup>Wt</sup>, and upregulation of PIK3R1 in IDH1<sup>Mu</sup>. Additionally, PIK3R1 and ITGB2 emerged as critical druggable targets. Our findings indicate that PDCD1 and CD274 are highly expressed irrespective of IDH1 mutation statuses, suggesting that glioblastomas could benefit from immunotherapy. Moreover, IDH1<sup>Mu</sup> glioblastomas may require a combination of PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors and immunotherapy due to PIK3R1 overexpression.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

In the following 20 years, it has lived up to expectations. A substantial body of evidence has demonstrated that it is closely related to the development, metastasis, migration, and drug resistance of malignant tumors. In recent years, research on the MSI protein has advanced, and many novel viewpoints and drug resistance attempts have been derived; for example, tumor protein p53 mutations and MSI-binding proteins lead to resistance to protein arginine N-methyltransferase 5-targeted therapy in lymphoma patients. Moreover, the high expression of MSI2 in pancreatic cancer might suppress its development and progression. As a significant member of the MSI family, MSI2 is closely associated with multiple malignant tumors, including hematological disorders, common abdominal tumors, and other tumor types (e.g., glioblastoma, breast cancer). MSI2 is highly expressed in the majority of tumors and is related to a poor disease prognosis. However, its specific expression levels and regulatory mechanisms may differ based on the tumor type. This review summarizes the research progress related to MSI2 in recent years, including its occurrence, migration mechanism, and drug resistance, as well as the prospect of developing tumor immunosuppressants and biomarkers.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Although the survival is generally dismal for glioblastoma patients, risk stratification and the identification of high-risk subgroups is important for prompt and aggressive management. The G1-G7 molecular subgroup classification based on the MAPK pathway activation has offered for the first time a non-redundant, all-inclusive classification of adult glioblastoma. Five patients from the large, 218-patient, prospective cohort showed germline mutations in mismatch repair (MMR) genes (Lynch syndrome) and a significantly worse median survival of 3.25 months post-surgery than those from the G1/EGFR and G3/NF1 major subgroups, or from the rest of the cohort adjusted for age. These rare tumors were assigned to a new subgroup, G3/MMR, a G3/NF1 subgroup spin-off, as they generally show genomic alterations leading to RAS activation, such as <i>NF1</i> and <i>PTPN11</i> mutations. An integrated clinical, histologic and molecular analysis of the G3/MMR tumors showed distinct characteristics as compared to other glioblastomas, including those with iatrogenic high tumor mutation burden (TMB), warranting a separate subgroup. Prior history of cancer, midline location or multifocality, presence of multinucleated giant cells (MGCs), positive p53 and MMR immunohistochemistry, and specific molecular characteristics, including high TMB, <i>MSH2</i>/<i>MSH6</i> alterations, biallelic <i>TP53</i> Arg mutations and co-occurring <i>PIK3CA</i> p.R88Q and <i>PTEN</i> alterations, alert to this high-risk G3/MMR subgroup. The MGCs and p53 immunohistochemistry analysis in G1-G7 subgroups showed that one in 7 tumors with these characteristics is a G3/MMR glioblastoma. The FDA-approved first-line therapy for many advanced solid tumors consists of nivolumab-ipilimumab immune checkpoint inhibitors. One G3/MMR patient received this regimen and survived much longer than the rest, setting a proof-of-principle example for the treatment of these very aggressive G3/MMR glioblastomas.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Disruption of the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway in tumor cells enhances the effectiveness of radiotherapy drugs, while increased mutational burden following tumor cell damage also facilitates the efficacy of immunotherapy. The ATRX gene, located on chromosome X, plays a crucial role in DDR. The aim of this research is to elucidate the correlation between ATRX mutations and GBM. Dataset obtained from TCGA-GBM were conducted an analysis on the genomic features, biological characteristics, immunopathological markers, and clinical prognosis of patients carrying ATRX mutations. Our findings revealed a significantly elevated level of microsatellite instability in individuals with ATRX mutants, along with significant alterations in the receptor-tyrosine kinase (RTK)-ras pathway among patients exhibiting combined ATRX mutations. TCGA-GBM patients with concurrent ATRX mutations exhibited sensitivity to 26 chemotherapeutic and anticancer drugs, which exerted their effects by modulating the DDR of tumor cells through highly correlated mechanisms involving the RTK-ras pathway. Additionally, we observed an enrichment of ATRX mutations in specific pathways associated with DDR among TCGA-GBM patients. Our model also demonstrated prolonged overall survival in patients carrying ATRX mutations, particularly showing strong predictive value for 3- and 5-year survival rates. Furthermore, additional protective factors such as younger age, female gender, combined IDH mutations, and TP53 mutations were identified. The results underscore the protective role and prognostic significance of ATRX mutations in GBM as a potential therapeutic target and biomarker for patient survival.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Available systemic treatment options are few and ineffective, so new approaches to therapies for glioblastoma are in high demand. In total, 131 patients with diffuse glioma were studied. Paired tumor–normal samples were sequenced on the Illumina platform; the panel included 812 genes associated with cancer development. Molecular profiles in clinically distinct groups were investigated.

Despite current therapies, the 5-year survival rate is 5%-10%. The authors report a case with a durable long-term response to immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibition in a patient with LFS-associated GBM. An 18-year-old female presented after a syncopal episode and left leg weakness and was found to have a right frontal tumor. She underwent gross-total resection of the tumor (grade IV giant cell GBM IDH-wildtype, MGMT unmethylated, associated with a p53 germline mutation), radiation, and chemotherapy. On later imaging, increased enhancement was demonstrated, which raised concerns for tumor recurrence, and she underwent stereotactic radiosurgery followed by lomustine and procarbazine. These agents were later replaced with bevacizumab after a second resection, negative for recurrent glioma. Subsequently, nivolumab was added, given concerns for tumor progression, and the patient showed improvement within 5 months. The patient has continued nivolumab monotherapy and has had progression-free survival for more than 7 years. Despite advances in treatment, the median survival of patients with GBM is only 15 months. This case highlights the potential of immunotherapy with PD-L1 checkpoint inhibition in improving outcomes for LFS-associated GBM patients. https://thejns.org/doi/10.3171/CASE24539.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Necroptosis, a pathological hallmark of GBM, is poorly understood in terms of its role in prognosis, tumor microenvironment (TME) alteration, and immunotherapy. We assessed the expression of 55 necroptosis-related genes in GBM and normal brain tissues. We identified necroptosis-stratified clusters using Uni-Cox and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression to establish the 10-gene Glioblastoma Necroptosis Index (GNI). GNI demonstrated significant prognostic efficacy in the TCGA dataset (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u2009160) and internal validation dataset (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u2009345) and in external validation cohorts (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u2009591). The GNI-high subgroup displayed a mesenchymal phenotype, lacking the IDH1 mutation, and MGMT methylation. This subgroup was characterized by significant enrichment in inflammatory and humoral immune pathways with prominent cell adhesion molecules (CD44 and ICAM1), inflammatory cytokines (TGFB1, IL1B, and IL10), and chemokines (CX3CL1, CXCL9, and CCL5). The TME in this subgroup showed elevated infiltration of M0 macrophages, neutrophils, mast cells, and regulatory T cells. GNI-related genes appeared to limit macrophage polarization, as confirmed by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. The top 30% high-risk score subset exhibited increased CD8 T cell infiltration and enhanced cytolytic activity. GNI showed promise in predicting responses to immunotherapy and targeted treatment. Our study highlights the role of necroptosis-related genes in glioblastoma (GBM) and their effects on the tumor microenvironment and patient prognosis. TheGNI demonstrates potential as a prognostic marker and provides insights into immune characteristics and treatment responsiveness.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

LASSO analysis constructed the best prediction model composed of 13 genes in S2 with an accuracy of 96.7%, and the prediction model consisting of 17 genes in S3 with an accuracy of 86.7%, and screened 14 genes as components of the best prediction model in S4 with an accuracy of 93%.

We leverage in silico tools to investigate whether the occurrence of mutations in proteins previously described as immunogenic and highly expressed by glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), such as Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1), Phosphatase and Tensin homolog (PTEN) and Tumor Protein 53 (TP53), may be contributing to the differential presentation of immunogenic epitopes. We recovered Class I MHC binding information from wild-type and mutated proteins using the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB). After that, we built peptide-MHC (pMHC-I) models in HLA-arena, followed by hierarchical clustering analysis based on electrostatic surface features from each complex. We identified point mutations that are determinants for the presentation of a set of peptides from TP53 protein. We point to structural features in the pMHC-I complexes of wild-type and mutated peptides, which may play a role in the recognition of CD8 T cells. To further explore these features, we performed 100\xa0ns molecular dynamics simulations for the peptide pairs (wt/mut) selected. In pursuit of novel therapeutic targets for GBM treatment, we selected peptides where our predictive results indicated that mutations would not disrupt epitope presentation, thereby maintaining a specific CD8 T cell immune response. These peptides hold potential for future GBM interventions, including peptide-based or mRNA vaccine development applications.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

To address these issues and personalise treatment approaches, we aimed to develop and validate robust multiomics molecular subtypes of IDHwt-GBM. Through this, we sought to uncover the distinct molecular signatures underlying these subtypes, paving the way for improved diagnosis and targeted therapy for this challenging disease. To identify stable molecular subtypes among 184 IDHwt-GBM patients from TCGA, we used the consensus clustering method to consolidate the results from ten advanced multiomics clustering approaches based on mRNA, lncRNA, and mutation data. We developed subtype prediction models using the PAM and machine learning algorithms based on mRNA and MRI data for enhanced clinical utility. These models were validated in five independent datasets, and an online interactive system was created. We conducted a comprehensive assessment of the clinical impact, drug treatment response, and molecular associations of the IDHwt-GBM subtypes. In the TCGA cohort, two molecular subtypes, class 1 and class 2, were identified through multiomics clustering of IDHwt-GBM patients. There was a significant difference in survival between Class 1 and Class 2 patients, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.68 [1.15-2.47]. This difference was validated in other datasets (CGGA: HR\u2009=\u20091.75[1.04, 2.94]; CPTAC: HR\u2009=\u20091.79[1.09-2.91]; GALSS: HR\u2009=\u20091.66[1.09-2.54]; UCSF: HR\u2009=\u20091.33[1.00-1.77]; UPENN HR\u2009=\u20091.29[1.04-1.58]). Additionally, class 2 was more sensitive to treatment with radiotherapy combined with temozolomide, and this sensitivity was validated in the GLASS cohort. Correspondingly, class 2 and class 1 exhibited significant differences in mutation patterns, enriched pathways, programmed cell death (PCD), and the tumour immune microenvironment. Class 2 had more mutation signatures associated with defective DNA mismatch repair (P\u2009=\u20090.0021). Enriched pathways of differentially expressed genes in class 1 and class 2 (P-adjust\u2009<\u20090.05) were mainly related to ferroptosis, the PD-1 checkpoint pathway, the JAK-STAT signalling pathway, and other programmed cell death and immune-related pathways. The different cell death modes and immune microenvironments were validated across multiple datasets. Finally, our developed survival prediction model, which integrates molecular subtypes, age, and sex, demonstrated clinical benefits based on the decision curve in the test set. We deployed the molecular subtyping prediction model and survival prediction model online, allowing interactive use and facilitating user convenience. Molecular subtypes were identified and verified through multiomics clustering in IDHwt-GBM patients.

Pediatric glioblastoma is a rare and aggressive brain tumor that presents unique challenges in treatment. It differs from its adult counterpart in terms of genetic and molecular characteristics. Its incidence is relatively low, but the prognosis remains grim due to its aggressive behavior. Diagnosis relies on imaging techniques and histopathological analysis. The rarity of the disease underscores the need for effective treatment strategies. In recent years, the quest to understand and manage pediatric glioblastoma has seen a significant shift towards unraveling the intricate landscape of biomarkers. Surgery remains a cornerstone of glioblastoma management, aiming to resect as much of the tumor as possible. Glioblastoma's infiltrative nature presents challenges in achieving a complete surgical resection. This comprehensive review delves into the realm of pediatric glioblastoma biomarkers, shedding light on their potential to not only revolutionize diagnostics but also shape therapeutic strategies. From personalized treatment selection to the development of targeted therapies, the potential impact of these biomarkers on clinical outcomes is undeniable. Moreover, this review underscores the substantial implications of biomarker-driven approaches for therapeutic interventions. All advancements in targeted therapies and immunotherapy hold promise for the treatment of pediatric glioblastoma. The genetic profiling of tumors allows for personalized approaches, potentially improving treatment efficacy. The ethical dilemmas surrounding pediatric cancer treatment, particularly balancing potential benefits with risks, are complex. Ongoing clinical trials and preclinical research suggest exciting avenues for future interventions.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2. Study type and methodology\n3.

With an evolving understanding of its underlying biology, there is an urgent need to identify prognostic molecular groups that can be subject to targeted therapy. This study established a cohort of 124 sequential glioblastomas from a tertiary hospital and aimed to find correlations between molecular features and survival outcomes. Comprehensive molecular characterization of the cohort revealed prevalent alterations as previously described, such as TERT promoter mutations and involvement of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR, CK4/6-CDKN2A/B-RB1, and p14ARF-MDM2-MDM4-p53 pathways. MGMT promoter methylation is a significant predictor of improved overall survival, aligned with previous data. Conversely, age showed a marginal association with higher mortality. Multivariate analysis to account for the effect of MGMT promoter methylation and age showed that, in contrast to other published series, this cohort demonstrated improved survival for tumors harboring PTEN mutations, and that there was no observed difference for most other molecular alterations, including EGFR amplification, RB1 loss, or the coexistence of EGFR amplification and deletion/exon skipping (EGFRvIII). Despite limitations in sample size, this study contributes data to the molecular landscape of glioblastomas, prompting further investigations to examine these findings more closely in larger cohorts.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Survival varies considerably by grade, histology, biomarkers, and genetic alterations such as IDH mutations and <i>MGMT</i> promoter methylation, and treatment, but is poor for some grades and histologies, with many patients with glioblastoma surviving less than a year from diagnosis. The present review provides an introduction to glioma, including its classification, epidemiology, economic and humanistic burden, as well as treatment options. Another focus is on treatment recommendations for IDH-mutant astrocytoma, IDH-mutant oligodendroglioma, and glioblastoma, which were synthesized from recent guidelines. While recommendations are nuanced and reflect the complexity of the disease, maximum safe resection is typically the first step in treatment, followed by radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy using temozolomide or procarbazine, lomustine, and vincristine. Immunotherapies and targeted therapies currently have only a limited role due to disappointing clinical trial results, including in recurrent glioblastoma, for which the nitrosourea lomustine remains the <i>de facto</i> standard of care. The lack of treatment options is compounded by frequently suboptimal clinical practice, in which patients do not receive adequate therapy after resection, including delayed, shortened, or discontinued radiotherapy and chemotherapy courses due to treatment side effects. These unmet needs will require significant efforts to address, including a continued search for novel treatment options, increased awareness of clinical guidelines, improved toxicity management for chemotherapy, and the generation of additional and more robust clinical and health economic evidence.\n\nConsider:\n1.

This study reclassified the adult diffuse glioma (ADG) into astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, and glioblastoma (GBM) according to the new tumor classification. The association of TERT promoter (pTERT) mutation, MGMT methylation, and CD47/TIGIT expression with patient prognosis was investigated. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the expression levels of CD47 and TIGIT in tumor tissues were significantly higher than those in normal brain tissues. CD47 levels were higher in GBM and grade 4 astrocytoma tissues. TIGIT expression was also higher in patients with GBM. The high expressions of CD47, TIGIT, and CD47/TIGIT were positively correlated with <i>MGMT</i> unmethylation but not p<i>TERT</i> mutation. Moreover, <i>MGMT</i> unmethylation was associated with poor overall survival in astrocytoma. High CD47, TIGIT, and CD47/TIGIT levels were associated with significantly reduced survival in ADG and GBM. GBM, <i>MGMT</i> unmethylation, and high CD47 expression were independent prognostic factors for overall survival in ADG. Collectively, these results showed that the <i>MGMT</i> unmethylation and high levels of CD47 and TIGIT are associated with a poor prognosis in ADG. Patients with high CD47 and TIGIT expression may benefit from anti-CD47 and TIGIT immunotherapy.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2. Study type and methodology\n3.

This review delves into the potential of targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) with small-molecule inhibitors and antibodies as a treatment strategy. EGFR, a mutationally active receptor tyrosine kinase in over 50% of glioblastoma cases, features variants like EGFRvIII, EGFRvII and missense mutations, necessitating a deep understanding of their structures and signaling pathways. Although EGFR inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in other cancers, their application in glioblastoma is hindered by blood-brain barrier penetration and intrinsic resistance. The evolving realm of nanodrugs and convection-enhanced delivery offers promise in ensuring precise drug delivery to the brain. Critical to success is the identification of glioblastoma patient populations that benefit from EGFR inhibitors. Tools like radiolabeled anti-EGFR antibody 806i facilitate the visualization of EGFR conformations, aiding in tailored treatment selection. Recognizing the synergistic potential of combination therapies with downstream targets like mTOR, PI3k, and HDACs is pivotal for enhancing EGFR inhibitor efficacy. In conclusion, the era of precision oncology holds promise for targeting EGFR in glioblastoma, contingent on tailored treatments, effective blood-brain barrier navigation, and the exploration of synergistic therapies.\n\nConsider:\n1.

In two thirds of patients, a specific subset of genes is upregulated from primary to recurrence (Up responders), and in one third, the same genes are downregulated (Down responders), specifically in neoplastic cells. Characterization of the responder subtypes indicates subtype-specific adaptive treatment resistance mechanisms that are associated with distinct changes in the tumor microenvironment. In Up responders, recurrent tumors are enriched in quiescent proneural GBM stem cells and differentiated neoplastic cells, with increased interaction with the surrounding normal brain and neurotransmitter signaling, whereas Down responders commonly undergo mesenchymal transition. ChIP-sequencing data from longitudinal GBM tumors suggests that the observed transcriptional reprogramming could be driven by Polycomb-based chromatin remodeling rather than DNA methylation. We show that the responder subtype is cancer-cell intrinsic, recapitulated in in vitro GBM cell models, and influenced by the presence of the tumor microenvironment. Stratifying GBM tumors by responder subtype may lead to more effective treatment.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2. Study type and methodology\n3. Population characteristics\n4.

The vast majority of these biomarkers, used to discriminate between tumour types, also offered prognostic information. With the advent of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and other large genomic datasets, further prognostic sub-stratification was possible within tumour types, leading to increased precision in CNS tumour grading. This review outlines the evolution of the molecular landscape of adult CNS tumours, through the prism of World Health Organization (WHO) Classifications. We begin our journey in the pre-molecular era, where high-grade gliomas were divided into 'primary' and 'secondary' glioblastomas. Molecular alterations explaining these clinicopathological observations were the first branching points of glioma diagnostics, with the discovery of IDH1/2 mutations and 1p/19q codeletion. Subsequently, the rigorous characterisation of paediatric gliomas led to the unearthing of histone H3 alterations as a key event in gliomagenesis, which also had implications for young adult patients. Simultaneously, studies investigating prognostic biomarkers within tumour types were undertaken. Certain genomic phenotypes were found to portend unfavourable outcomes, for example, MYCN amplification in spinal ependymoma. The arrival of methylation profiling, having revolutionised the diagnosis of CNS tumours, now promises to bring increased prognostic accuracy, as has been shown in meningiomas. While MGMT promoter hypermethylation has remained a reliable biomarker of response to cytotoxic chemotherapy, targeted therapy in CNS tumours has unfortunately not had the success of other cancers. Therefore, predictive biomarkers have lagged behind the identification of prognostic biomarkers in CNS tumours. Emerging research from new clinical trials is cause for guarded optimism and may shift our conceptualisation of predictive biomarker testing in CNS tumours.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Evidence suggests that glioma stem cells (GSCs) contribute to this resistance. Mithramycin (Mit-A) targets GSCs and exhibits antitumor activity in GBM by affecting transcriptional targets such as SRY-related HMG-box transcription factor 2 (SOX2), oligodendrocyte lineage transcription factor 2 (OLIG2), and zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1). However, its clinical use has been limited by toxicity. This study explored the diagnostic potential of serum extracellular vesicles (EVs) to identify Mit-A responders. Serum EVs were isolated from 70 glioma patients, and targeted gene expression was analyzed using qRT-PCR. Using chemosensitivity assay, we identified 8 Mit-A responders and 17 nonresponders among 25 glioma patients. The M-score showed a significant correlation (<i>p</i> = 0.045) with isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 mutation but not other clinical variables. The genes SOX2 (<i>p</i> = 0.005), OLIG2 (<i>p</i> = 0.003), and ZEB1 (<i>p</i> = 0.0281) were found to be upregulated in the responder EVs. SOX2 had the highest diagnostic potential (AUC = 0.875), followed by OLIG2 (AUC = 0.772) and ZEB1 (AUC = 0.632).The combined gene panel showed significant diagnostic efficacy (AUC = 0.956) through logistic regression analysis. The gene panel was further validated in the serum EVs of 45 glioma patients. These findings highlight the potential of Mit-A as a targeted therapy for high-grade glioma based on differential gene expression in serum EVs. The gene panel could serve as a diagnostic tool to predict Mit-A sensitivity, offering a promising approach for personalized treatment strategies and emphasizing the role of GSCs in therapeutic resistance.\n\nConsider:\n1.

There are limited reports on the immune profile of these tumors. In this study, we assessed 21 PXA [15 PXA Grade 2 (PXAG2); 6 PXA Grade 3 (PXAG3)] and 14 eGB for their histopathological and molecular association. Further, their immune profile was compared with GB, IDH1 wild-type (wt) (n-18). Morphologically, PXAG2 mostly differed from eGB; however, it was occasionally difficult to differentiate PXAG3 from eGB due to their epithelioid pattern and less obvious degenerative features. PXAG2 showed predominantly diffuse, whereas variable positivity for epithelial and glial markers was seen in PXAG3 and eGB. All cases showed retained nuclear ATRX and INI-1 . H3K27M or IDH1 mutation was seen in none. P53 mutation was more common in eGB, followed by PXAG3, and least common in PXAG2. BRAF V600E mutation was observed in 66.67% PXAG2, 33.33% PXAG3, and 50% eGB, with 100% concordance between immunohistochemistry (IHC) and sequencing. Thirty-six percent eGB, 33% PXAG3, and 61% PXAG2 harbored CDKN2A homozygous deletion. EGFR amplification was observed in 14% eGB and 66% of GB, IDH wt. PDL1 and CTLA-4 expression was higher in eGB (71.4% and 57.1%), PXAG3 (66.6% and100%), and PXAG2 (60% & 66.7%) as compared with GB, IDH wt (38.8% and 16.7%). Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were also observed in a majority of eGB and PXA (90% to 100%) in contrast to GB, IDH wt (66%). This analysis highlights the homogenous molecular and immune profile of eGB and PXA, suggesting the possibility that histologically and molecularly, these two entities represent 2 ends of a continuous spectrum with PXAG3 lying in between. Higher upregulation of PDL1, CTLA-4, and increased tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in these tumors as compared with GB, IDH wt suggests potential candidature for immunotherapy.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Using glioblastoma (GBM) as a representative example of high-grade gliomas, we evaluated the clonal architecture and distribution of hotspot mutations in 388 GBMs from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Mutations were matched with 54 targeted therapies, followed by a comprehensive evaluation of drug biochemical properties in reference to the drug's clinical efficacy in high-grade gliomas. We then assessed clinical outcomes of a cohort of patients with high-grade gliomas with targetable mutations reviewed at the Johns Hopkins Molecular Tumor Board (JH MTB; <i>n</i>\u2009=\u200950). Among 1,156 sequence alterations evaluated, 28.6% represented hotspots. While the frequency of hotspot mutations in GBM was comparable to cancer types with actionable hotspot alterations, GBMs harbored a higher fraction of subclonal mutations that affected hotspots (7.0%), compared to breast cancer (4.9%), lung cancer (4.4%), and melanoma (1.4%). In investigating the biochemical features of targeted therapies paired with recurring alterations, we identified a trend toward higher lipid solubility and lower IC<sub>50</sub> in GBM cell lines among drugs with clinical efficacy. The drugs' half-life, molecular weight, surface area and binding to efflux transporters were not associated with clinical efficacy. Among the JH MTB cohort of patients with <i>IDH1</i> wild-type high-grade gliomas who received targeted therapies, trametinib monotherapy or in combination with dabrafenib conferred radiographic partial response in 75% of patients harboring <i>BRAF</i> or <i>NF1</i> actionable mutations. Cabozantinib conferred radiographic partial response in two patients harboring a <i>MET</i> and a <i>PDGFRA/KDR</i> amplification. Patients with <i>IDH1</i> wild-type gliomas that harbored actionable alterations who received genotype-matched targeted therapy had longer progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS; 7.37 and 14.72 respectively) than patients whose actionable alterations were not targeted (2.83 and 4.2\u2009months respectively). While multiple host, tumor and drug-related features may limit the delivery and efficacy of targeted therapies for patients with high-grade gliomas, genotype-matched targeted therapies confer favorable clinical outcomes. Further studies are needed to generate more data on the impact of biochemical features of targeted therapies on their clinical efficacy for high-grade gliomas.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Through prospective genomic profiling of 459 consecutive primary treatment-naïve IDH-wildtype glioblastomas in adults, we identified a unique subgroup (2%, 9/459) defined by somatic hypermutation and DNA replication repair deficiency due to biallelic inactivation of a canonical mismatch repair gene. The deleterious mutations in mismatch repair genes were often present in the germline in the heterozygous state with somatic inactivation of the remaining allele, consistent with glioblastomas arising due to underlying Lynch syndrome. A subset of tumors had accompanying proofreading domain mutations in the DNA polymerase POLE and resultant "ultrahypermutation". The median age at diagnosis was 50 years (range 27-78), compared with 63 years for the other 450 patients with conventional glioblastoma (p\u2009<\u20090.01). All tumors had histologic features of the giant cell variant of glioblastoma. They lacked EGFR amplification, lacked combined trisomy of chromosome 7 plus monosomy of chromosome 10, and only rarely had TERT promoter mutation or CDKN2A homozygous deletion, which are hallmarks of conventional IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. Instead, they harbored frequent inactivating mutations in TP53, NF1, PTEN, ATRX, and SETD2 and recurrent activating mutations in PDGFRA. DNA methylation profiling revealed they did not align with known reference adult glioblastoma methylation classes, but instead had unique globally hypomethylated epigenomes and mostly classified as "Diffuse pediatric-type high grade glioma, RTK1 subtype, subclass A". Five patients were treated with immune checkpoint blockade, four of whom survived greater than 3\xa0years. The median overall survival was 36.8 months, compared to 15.5 months for the other 450 patients (p\u2009<\u20090.001). We conclude that "De novo replication repair deficient glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype" represents a biologically distinct subtype in the adult population that may benefit from prospective identification and treatment with immune checkpoint blockade.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Tumor-normal paired sequencing (Illumina, 812-gene panel) identified key mutations, with IDH1/2 (78%) and TP53 (44%) prevalent in low-grade gliomas (LGG, n=18), while CDKN2A/B (33%), TERT promoter (71%), PTEN (60%), TP53 (27%), and EGFR (40%) were common in high-grade gliomas (HGG, n=113). IDH1/2 mutations correlated with better prognosis, whereas TERTp mutations and PTEN deletions were linked to poor outcomes. In IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, prior cancer history predicted worse survival, while re-operation and bevacizumab improved overall survival. Nine patients received molecular targeted therapy, with results evaluated but not detailed. These findings emphasize the prognostic value of genetic alterations and their potential to guide treatment selection, including targeted therapies and immunotherapy.\n\nArticle PMID:39085480\nThis study classified four novel molecular subtypes of glioblastoma (GBM) using genomic and proteomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), aiming to predict treatment response for personalized therapy. Key findings include:\n\n1. **Main Findings & Conclusions**:  \n   - **S1**: Low proliferative profile.  \n   - **S2**: Characterized by high proliferation, **IDH1 mutation**, **TP53 mutation**, and deletion.  \n   - **S3**: High immune scores, strong innate/adaptive immune infiltration, **lowest Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) score**, suggesting the best response to **immunotherapy**.  \n   - **S4**: High proliferation, **EGFR amplification**, and high protein abundance, making it the most suitable for **bevacizumab** treatment.  \n\n2. **Methodology Overview**:  \n   - Molecular subtyping was performed using **BayesNM** and compared with existing classifications.  \n   - Gene set enrichment analysis identified biological features.  \n   - Immune profiling assessed immune cell infiltration and immune molecule expression.  \n   - **LASSO logistic regression** was used to develop predictive models for treatment response.  \n\n3. **Population Characteristics**:  \n   - GBM samples were sourced from **TCGA**.  \n   - Genomic and proteomic data were integrated for classification.  \n\n4. **Key Statistical Results**:  \n   - **S2 predictive model**: 13 genes, **96.7% accuracy**.  \n   - **S3 predictive model**: 17 genes, **86.7% accuracy**.  \n   - **S4 predictive model**: 14 genes, **93% accuracy**.  \n\n5. **Clinical Implications**:  \n   - **IDH1/TP53-mutated GBM (S2)** may require distinct treatment strategies.  \n   - **Immunotherapy is most effective for S3**, due to high immune infiltration and low TIDE score.  \n   - **EGFR-amplified GBM (S4) responds best to bevacizumab**, indicating potential for targeted therapy.  \n   - These molecular subtypes provide a **framework for personalized GBM treatment** and could improve prognosis by tailoring therapies to genetic profiles.  \n\nThis study enhances precision medicine by identifying **GBM subtypes with differential treatment responses**, guiding the use of **immunotherapy\n\nArticle PMID:38890658\nThis study investigated the molecular heterogeneity of IDH1-wildtype glioblastoma (IDHwt-GBM) to improve prognosis prediction and treatment personalization. Using multiomics clustering of 184 TCGA patients (validated in five independent cohorts), two molecular subtypes (Class 1 and Class 2) were identified, differing in survival outcomes (TCGA: HR = 1.68 [1.15-2.47]; validation cohorts HR range: 1.29–1.79). Class 2 exhibited greater sensitivity to radiotherapy plus temozolomide, confirmed in the GLASS cohort. Mutation patterns and enriched pathways varied between subtypes, with Class 2 showing more DNA mismatch repair defects (P = 0.0021) and Class 1 linked to ferroptosis, PD-1, and JAK-STAT pathways. Differences in immune microenvironments and programmed cell death mechanisms were validated across datasets. A survival prediction model incorporating these subtypes, age, and sex demonstrated clinical utility. These findings suggest that molecular subtyping of IDHwt-GBM can guide treatment strategies, particularly in selecting patients for immunotherapy and DNA repair-targeting therapies.\n\nProvide a comprehensive synthesis that:\n1.

Conventional methods for assessing MGMT promoter methylation, such as methylation-specific PCR, are invasive and require tissue sampling. <b>Methods</b>: A comprehensive literature search was performed in compliance with the updated PRISMA 2020 guidelines within electronic databases MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, and IEEE Xplore. Search terms, including "MGMT", "methylation", "glioma", "glioblastoma", "machine learning", "deep learning", and "radiomics", were adopted in various MeSH combinations. Original studies in the English, Italian, German, and French languages were considered for inclusion. <b>Results</b>: This review analyzed 34 studies conducted in the last six years, focusing on assessing MGMT methylation status using radiomics (RD), deep learning (DL), or combined approaches. These studies utilized radiological data from the public (e.g., BraTS, TCGA) and private institutional datasets. Sixteen studies focused exclusively on glioblastoma (GBM), while others included low- and high-grade gliomas. Twenty-seven studies reported diagnostic accuracy, with fourteen achieving values above 80%. The combined use of DL and RD generally resulted in higher accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, although some studies reported lower minimum accuracy compared to studies using a single model. <b>Conclusions:</b> The integration of RD and DL offers a powerful, non-invasive tool for precisely recognizing MGMT promoter methylation status in gliomas, paving the way for enhanced personalized medicine in neuro-oncology. The heterogeneity of study populations, data sources, and methodologies reflected the complexity of the pipeline and machine learning algorithms, which may require general standardization to be implemented in clinical practice.\n\nConsider:\n1.

In this study, we employed an integrative multi-omics approach, including targeted proteomics, transcriptomics, genomics, and DNA methylation profiling, to investigate the response of a representative panel of GBM patient-derived cancer stem cells (CSCs) to astrocytic differentiation and RT and TMZ treatments. Differentiated CSC progenies retained the expression of key stemness genes and survival pathways, while activating the BMP-Smad signaling pathway and upregulating extracellular matrix components. This was associated with increased resistance to TMZ, though not to RT, across all models. We identified TP53 status as a critical determinant of transcriptional response to both RT and TMZ, which was also modulated by the differentiation state and treatment modality in wildtype (wt) p53 GBM cells. Both mutant and wt p53 models exhibited significant activation of the DNA-damage associated interferon (IFN) response in CSCs and differentiated cells, implicating this pathway in the GBM response to therapy. We observed that activation of NF-κB was positively correlated with the levels of O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) protein, a direct DNA repair enzyme leading to TMZ resistance, regardless of MGMT promoter methylation status, further supporting the clinical potential for inhibition of NF-kB signaling in GBM treatment. Our integrative analysis of the impact of GBM cell developmental states, in the context of genomic and molecular diversity of patient-derived models, provides valuable insights for pre-clinical studies aimed at optimizing treatment strategies.\n\nConsider:\n1.

In this study, we employed an integrative multi-omics approach, including targeted proteomics, transcriptomics, genomics, and DNA methylation profiling, to investigate the response of a representative panel of GBM patient-derived cancer stem cells (CSCs) to astrocytic differentiation and RT and TMZ treatments. Differentiated CSC progenies retained the expression of key stemness genes and survival pathways, while activating the BMP-Smad signaling pathway and upregulating extracellular matrix components. This was associated with increased resistance to TMZ, though not to RT, across all models. We identified TP53 status as a critical determinant of transcriptional response to both RT and TMZ, which was also modulated by the differentiation state and treatment modality in wildtype (wt) p53 GBM cells. Both mutant and wt p53 models exhibited significant activation of the DNA-damage associated interferon (IFN) response in CSCs and differentiated cells, implicating this pathway in the GBM response to therapy. We observed that activation of NF-κB was positively correlated with the levels of O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) protein, a direct DNA repair enzyme leading to TMZ resistance, regardless of MGMT promoter methylation status, further supporting the clinical potential for inhibition of NF-kB signaling in GBM treatment. Our integrative analysis of the impact of GBM cell developmental states, in the context of genomic and molecular diversity of patient-derived models, provides valuable insights for pre-clinical studies aimed at optimizing treatment strategies.\n\nProvide a focused summary that:\n1.

The aim of this study was to discover actionable alterations and to match these with targeted therapies. Between January 2016 and December 2023, 483 brain tumor patients were profiled. We retrieved clinical data and molecular data. Whole exome, whole genome, or panel sequencing, along with SNP array analyses, and RNA-seq were performed on resected primary tumor tissue. Alterations were classified according to the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Scale for Clinical Actionability of Molecular Targets (ESCAT) following the European Association of Neuro-Oncology (EANO) guideline on rational molecular testing. A total of 200 (41.4%) patients' tumors harbored an alteration of interest according to the EANO guideline. Twenty (4.1%) patients had an ESCAT high-tier alteration (tier I or II), while 155 patients (32.1%) had an alteration corresponding to ESCAT IIIA. Thirty-five patients (7.2%) had an actionable alteration, and 15 (3.1%) received targeted therapy. The treated targets were BRAFV600E mutations, FGFR alterations, NTRK fusions, PDGFRA fusions, PTPRZ1-MET fusions, and TMB-high. The overall response rate was 20%, with a median duration of response of 12 months, and 47% achieved stable disease as the best response. Genomic profiling uncovers alterations of interest in a substantial number of patients, but only a minority are considered by the Danish National Molecular Tumor Board to have actionable alterations, and even fewer receive targeted therapy. Nevertheless, factors, such as promising targets and the increasing availability of trials, may contribute to a future increase in the number of patients benefiting from targeted therapies based on genomic profiling.\n\nConsider:\n1.

N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification plays a critical role in the development of brain tumor. WTAP and ZC3H13 have been identified across various species. Immune contexture, which includes the tumor microenvironment (TME), plays a significant role in cancer progression and treatment. This study aimed to explore the potential impact between WTAP and ZC3H13 on the immunological characteristics of GBM. We utilized data from TCGA-GBM, GEO and CGGA datasets to obtain platform and probe data. Patients with GBM were stratified into two clusters based on the expression of WTAP and ZC3H13 using consensus clustering approach. Immune infiltration within the tumor microenvironment was assessed using ESTIMATE, CIBERSORT and ssGSEA methodologies. Functional disparities were determined through gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Tumor mutation burden (TMB) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) were also analyzed. Co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to identify genes associated with WTAP/ZC3H13 and immunity. Validation was performed using GEO and CGGA datasets. Our analysis revealed that cluster1 exhibited higher WTAP expression but lower ZC3H13 expression compared to cluster2. Cluster1 showed higher levels of immune infiltration and TMB compared to cluster2. WGCNA identified 15 genes closely associated with WTAP/ZC3H13 expression and immune scores, notably CTLA4, CD27, ICOS, and LAG3. Our results suggested that WTAP and ZC3H13 influence on immune contexture of GBM, providing new insights into tumor immunity in GBM.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

Here, we assessed the prevalence of MGMT methylation status among GBM patients in the United States. Additionally, we evaluated treatment practices and survival outcomes of GBM patients according to MGMT promoter methylation status. The National Cancer Database was queried to identify all adult U.S. patients (≥\u200918 years) diagnosed with IDH-wildtype GBM between 2018 and 2020. Treatment regimen was grouped into no chemotherapy and no radiotherapy, chemotherapy alone (without radiotherapy), radiotherapy alone (without chemotherapy), and chemoradiotherapy (chemotherapy and radiotherapy). Survival data were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves, log-rank tests, and multivariable Cox proportional hazard modeling. A total of 20,734 patients were included, of whom 6,404 (30.9%) had MGMT-methylated GBM, 9,065 (43.7%) had MGMT-unmethylated tumors, and 5,265 (25.4%) had unknown methylation status. The median and three-year overall survival were 12.4 months and 15.5%, respectively, for the entire cohort (16.4 months and 23.9% for MGMT-methylated patients and 11.8 months and 9.8% for MGMT-unmethylated patients, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Chemoradiotherapy was less commonly used for elderly (≥\u200970 years, 58.5%) than non-elderly (<\u200970 years, 79.2%) patients. Among elderly patients, radiotherapy alone was more commonly administered than chemotherapy alone for patients with MGMT-unmethylated tumors (11.2% vs. 2.1%) and MGMT-methylated tumors (6.6% vs. 3.9%). However, chemotherapy alone was associated with a lower mortality risk (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.51-0.99, p\u2009=\u20090.04) than radiotherapy alone for elderly patients with MGMT-methylated tumors, while chemotherapy alone was associated with a higher mortality risk (HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.09-2.44, p\u2009=\u20090.02) than radiotherapy alone for elderly patients with MGMT-unmethylated tumors. Patients who were elderly, uninsured, insured through Medicaid, lived in zip codes with lower median education levels, or received care at non-academic programs were less likely to undergo MGMT testing. A high proportion of GBM patients in the United States undergo MGMT promoter testing, though significant sociodemographic disparities exist. While there was a decrease in chemoradiotherapy use with increasing age, radiotherapy alone was more commonly administered to elderly patients than chemotherapy alone irrespective of MGMT promoter methylation status.\n\nConsider:\n1.

It may be happened because of drug resistance against their typical receptors, since these receptor genes are often mutated by environmental stress. So identifying mutated oncodriver genes which could be used as potential drug target is essential in order to develop effective new therapeutic drugs as well as better prognosis for GBM patients. In this study, we analyzed whole exome sequencing (WES) profiles of NCBI database on GBM and matched-normal (control) samples originated from astrocyte like neural stem cells (NSC) of subventricular zone (SVZ) to explore GBM-causing mutated oncodriver genes, since SVZ is considered as the origin of GBM development. We detected 16 mutated oncodriver genes. Then, filtering by differential co-expression analysis based on independent RNA-Seq profiles of CGGA database revealed 10 genes as dysregulated oncodriver genes. Following that, 3 significantly overexpressed oncodriver genes (MTCH2, VWF, and WDR89) were identified as potential drug targets. Then molecular mechanisms of GBM development were investigated by these three overexpressed driver genes through gene ontology (GO), KEGG-pathways, Gene regulatory network (GRN) and mutation analysis. Finally, overexpressed oncodriver genes guided top-ranked six drug agents (Irinotecan, Imatinib, etoposide, pazopanib, trametinib and cabozanitinib) were recommended against GBM through molecular docking study. Most of our findings received support by the literature review also. Therefore, the findings of this study might carry potential values to the wet-lab researchers for further investigation in terms of diagnosis and therapies of GBM.\n\nConsider:\n1.

We analyzed the frequency of PD-L1 expression in glioma samples. Methodology In this two-year retrospective study, 45 glioma cases of varying grades (grades 2 to 4) were examined at a tertiary care hospital. Tumor samples that were formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) were obtained from the pathology archives of the hospital. According to the WHO Classification of Central Nervous System Tumors, 5th edition, tumor grading and histopathological subtyping were carried out. PD-L1 antibody (clone 28-8) and IDH1 (R132H, clone QM002, Quartett Immunodiagnostika, 1:100 dilution) markers were used for immunohistochemistry (IHC). The sections underwent deparaffinization, rehydration, and antigen retrieval using Leica bond III staining platform. Based on the tumor proportion score (TPS), which is the proportion of viable tumor cells with membranous staining, PD-L1 expression was assessed. The literature's standardized cut-off values were used to determine positive expression. Staining intensity and tumor cell location were used to determine the status of IDH1 mutations. Age, sex, and tumor location were among the clinical and demographic information gathered about the patient. The association between PD-L1 expression, glioma grades, and IDH1 (R132H) mutation status was assessed statistically using SPSS software and a Chi-square test. The threshold for statistical significance was p < 0.05. For every IHC run, positive and negative controls were used as part of the quality control procedures. To reduce bias and guarantee consistency, two pathologists and post graduate residents independently reviewed the results. Results PD-L1 expression was found in 27 out of 36 (75%) grade 4 glioblastoma multiforme cases and six out of nine (66.7%) grade 2 gliomas. Overall, 33/45 (73.3%) of the gliomas had PD-L1 expression. However, PD-L1 expression and glioma grade did not correlate in a statistically significant way. IDH1 (R132H) expression and PD-L1 were found to be inversely correlated (p < 0.05). Conclusion The findings suggest that PD-L1 may be a promising therapeutic target, even in the absence of significant grade-specific trends by\xa0demonstrating PD-L1 presence in the majority of glioma cases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in GBM immunotherapy. The results provide insight into the immune landscape of gliomas and pave the way for future research into effective combination therapies for GBM, despite the lack of a significant correlation between glioma grade and PD-L1 expression.\n\nConsider:\n1.

This study aims to develop a comprehensive prognostic model to identify biomarkers associated with temozolomide (TMZ) resistance. We employed a multifaceted approach, combining differential expression and univariate Cox regression analyses to screen for TMZ resistance-related differentially expressed genes (TMZR-RDEGs) in GBM. Using LASSO Cox analysis, we selected 12 TMZR-RDEGs to construct a risk score model, which was evaluated for performance through survival analysis, time-dependent ROC, and stratified analyses. Functional enrichment and mutation analyses were conducted to explore the underlying mechanisms of the risk score and its relationship with immune cell infiltration levels in GBM. The prognostic risk score model, based on the 12 TMZR-RDEGs, demonstrated high efficacy in predicting GBM patient outcomes and emerged as an independent predictive factor. Additionally, we focused on the molecule TSPAN13, whose role in GBM is not well understood. We assessed cell proliferation, migration, and invasion capabilities through in vitro assays (including CCK-8, Edu, wound healing, and transwell assays) and quantitatively analyzed TSPAN13 expression levels in clinical glioma samples using tissue microarray immunohistochemistry. The impact of TSPAN13 on TMZ resistance in GBM cells was validated through in vitro experiments and a mouse orthotopic xenograft model. Notably, TSPAN13 was upregulated in GBM and correlated with poorer patient prognosis. Knockdown of TSPAN13 inhibited GBM cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and enhanced sensitivity to TMZ treatment. This study provides a valuable prognostic tool for GBM and identifies TSPAN13 as a critical target for therapeutic intervention.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

This review discusses the application, emerging trends, and challenges associated with using radiomics in glioma. Integrating deep learning algorithms enhances various radiomics components, including image normalization, region of interest segmentation, feature extraction, feature selection, and model construction and can potentially improve model accuracy and performance. Moreover, investigating specific tumor habitats of glioblastomas aids in a better understanding of glioblastoma aggressiveness and the development of effective treatment strategies. Additionally, advanced imaging techniques, such as diffusion-weighted imaging, perfusion-weighted imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, magnetic resonance fingerprinting, functional MRI, and positron emission tomography, can provide supplementary information for tumor characterization and classification. Furthermore, radiomics analysis helps understand the glioma immune microenvironment by predicting immune-related biomarkers and characterizing immune responses within tumors. Integrating multi-omics data, such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and pathomics, with radiomics, aids the understanding of the biological significance of the underlying radiomics features and improves the prediction of genetic mutations, prognosis, and treatment response in patients with glioma. Addressing challenges, such as model reproducibility, model generalizability, model interpretability, and multi-omics data integration, is crucial for the clinical translation of radiomics in glioma.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Here, we characterized 5 murine GBM stem-like cell (mGSC) models derived from lentivirus-induced tumors in transgenic mice that are driven by the activation of the Nf1-Ras signaling pathway and inactivation of Tp53. MGSC lines (005, RIG, NF53, C1, and C3) were cultured as spheres in serum-free stem cell media. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was employed to quantify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Stem cell properties were characterized by stemness in vitro and tumorigenicity after intracerebral implantation in C57BL/6 mice. Tumor phenotypes and the immune microenvironment were characterized by immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and RNA sequencing. WES revealed a large variation in coding sequence SNPs across mGSC lines (~20-fold), likely influenced by the mixed backgrounds of the parental mice. MGSCs exhibited variable clonogenic sphere formation and CD133 expression levels. In vivo, they consistently initiated lethal malignant gliomas, with median survival ranging from 29 to 82 days, and showed strong CD44 expression and variable invasiveness. The tumor microenvironment featured an abundance of CD68+ macrophages and uniform high PD-L1+ myeloid cells, while T-cell infiltration varied among the models, with low mutation burden C1 and C3 exhibiting fewer tumor-infiltrating T cells. Upon orthotopic implantation in immunocompetent mice, mGSCs generate tumors characteristic of human GBM. Despite similar strategies to generate these mGSCs, they exhibited a range of phenotypes and immune profiles in mGSC-derived orthotopic tumors. These mGSCs provide new preclinical GBM models for developing GBM immunotherapies.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2. Study type and methodology\n3. Population characteristics\n4.

Beyond its role in splicing, PRPF4 has been implicated in cell survival, apoptosis, and oncogenesis. Although PRPF4 mutations have been associated with retinitis pigmentosa, its role in glioblastoma (GBM) remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the function of PRPF4 in GBM progression and its potential as a therapeutic target. Gene expression profiling was conducted to compare PRPF4 levels between GBM tumors and normal tissues. PRPF4 expression was also evaluated in various cancer and GBM cell lines. Stable PRPF4 knockdown cell lines were established using A172 and T98G GBM cell lines. Cellular proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion were assessed through gene expression and functional assays. Additionally, molecular pathways affected by PRPF4 knockdown were examined, focusing on the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. Finally, metabolic processes in PRPF4 knockdown cells were estimated through proteomic analysis. PRPF4 expression was elevated in GBM. Knockdown of PRPF4 reduced cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, and suppressed migration and invasion in GBM cells. PRPF4 knockdown also suppressed MKK3/6-p38-ATF2 and RAS-MEK-ERK1/2 signaling pathways. Proteome analysis revealed disruptions in metabolic pathways, including glutathione and carbon metabolisms, which are associated with GBM progression. PRPF4 knockdown inhibits GBM progression by reducing p38 MAPK and ERK signaling cascade with metabolic alterations. Targeting PRPF4 may offer novel therapeutic strategies for GBM treatment.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2. Study type and methodology\n3. Population characteristics\n4.

HNF1B is a critical transcription element in vertebrate proliferation and oncogenesis, which has been shown to play roles in reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism. Our previous results have identified HNF1B as a tumor suppressor that could inhibit the malignant progression of prostate cancer. Yet there is no pan-carcinomatosis analysis of HNF1B, which could help us better understand common and unique underlying mechanisms in mankind knubs to enhance novel and competent treatment. Here, in our research, we evaluated the utterance pattern and explored the function of HNF1B in 33 knub categories using the data from the Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and CLNICAL PROTEOMICTUMOR ANALYSIS CONSORTIUM (CPTAC) dataset. We found different HNF1B roles in various cancer types. HNF1B was upregulated in CHOL, STAD, KIRP, and THCA, and was downregulated in GBM, KICH, COAD, KIRC, LUSC, SARC, PAAD, and TGCT. Prognostic analyses indicated that higher HNF1B displayed better illness outcomes in BLCA, READ, and PRAD, while poorer outcomes in LUSC and THYM. HNF1B mutation was most frequent in endometrial cancer but was not associated with disease prognosis. It was discovered that HNF1B utterance relevant to endothelial cell penetration status in BLCA, ESCA, LUAD, LUSC, and TGCT, and carcinomatosis-associated fibroblast infiltration was observed in ESCA, KIRC, LIHC, and TGCT. Moreover, functional enrichment analysis disclosed that metabolism-related functions were implicated in the function of HNF1B. Taken together, our pan- carcinomatosis analysis showed the complicated roles of HNF1B in a variety of carcinomatoses, being able to improve the extensive comprehension of HNF1B's role in tumorigenesis.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Alterations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number (CN) serve a crucial role in GBM development and progression, affecting various aspects of tumor biology, including energy production, oxidative stress regulation and cellular adaptability. Fluctuations in mtDNA levels, whether elevated or diminished, can impair mitochondrial function, potentially disrupting oxidative phosphorylation and amplifying reactive oxygen species generation, thereby fueling tumor growth and influencing treatment responses. Understanding the mechanisms of mtDNA‑CN variations, and their interplay with genetic and environmental elements in the tumor microenvironment, is essential for advancing diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Targeting mtDNA alterations could strengthen treatment efficacy, mitigate resistance and ultimately enhance the prognosis of patients with this aggressive brain tumor. The present review summarizes the existing literature on mtDNA alterations, specifically emphasizing variations in mtDNA‑CN and their association with GBM by surveying articles published between 1996 and 2024, sourced from databases such as Scopus, PubMed and Google Scholar. In addition, the review provides a brief overview of mitochondrial genome architecture, knowledge regarding the regulation of mtDNA integrity and CN, and how mitochondria significantly impact GBM tumorigenesis. This review further presents information on therapeutic approaches for restoring mtDNA‑CN that contribute to optimized mitochondrial function and improved health outcomes.\n\nConsider:\n1.

We employed a combination of genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), and scPagwas (pathway-based polygenic regression framework) methods to explore the genetic links between UDIPs and GBM. Two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses were conducted to identify causal relationships between UDIPs and GBM. Colocalization analysis was performed to validate genetic associations, while scPagwas analysis was used to evaluate the relevance of key UDIPs to GBM at the cellular level. Among 512 UDIPs tested, 23 were found to have significant causal associations with GBM. Notably, UDIPs such as T1-33 (OR\u2009=\u20091.007, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.001 to 1.012, P\u2009=\u2009.022), T1-34 (OR\u2009=\u20091.012, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.001-1.023, P\u2009=\u2009.028), and T1-96 (OR\u2009=\u20091.009, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.001-1.019, P\u2009=\u2009.046) were found to have a genetic association with GBM. Furthermore, T1-34 and T1-96 were significantly associated with GBM recurrence, with P-values < .0001 and P\u2009<\u2009.001, respectively. In addition, scPagwas analysis revealed that T1-33, T1-34, and T1-96 are distinctively linked to different GBM subtypes, with T1-33 showing strong associations with the neural progenitor-like subtype (NPC2), T1-34 with mesenchymal (MES2) and neural progenitor (NPC1) cells, and T1-96 with the NPC2 subtype. T1-33, T1-34, and T1-96 hold significant potential for predicting tumor recurrence and aiding in the development of personalized GBM treatment strategies.\n\nConsider:\n1.

However, no c-Met kinase inhibitors are currently approved specifically for the treatment of c-Met-amplified gastric cancer. Recently, bozitinib, a highly selective c-Met kinase inhibitor, has shown remarkable potency in selectively inhibiting MET-altered non-small cell lung cancer and secondary glioblastoma. In this study, we investigate the antitumor activity of bozitinib against MET-amplified gastric cancer and elucidate its molecular mechanism. Bozitinib demonstrates a strong effect on MET-amplified gastric cancer cells by blocking the c-Met signaling pathway, leading to the inhibition of cell proliferation and survival, as well as the induction of G0/G1 phase arrest and apoptosis. Structurally, bozitinib is optimally embedded in the ATP pocket of c-Met and firmly binds via an extensive interaction network. In addition, bozitinib efficiently inhibits c-Met resistance-conferring mutations G1163R and Y1230H, although its potency is significantly decreased against the D1228N and Y1230C mutations. Overall, our study reveals the molecular mechanism of bozitinib against c-Met, highlights its ability to overcome acquired resistance mutations, and provides valuable insights into further design and improvement of selective c-Met inhibitors.\n\nConsider:\n1.

The survival rate remains low despite standard therapies, highlighting the urgent need for novel treatment strategies. Advanced imaging techniques, particularly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are crucial in assessing GBM. Disruptions in various oncogenic signaling pathways, such as Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK)-Ras-Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling, Phosphoinositide 3- Kinases (PI3Ks), tumor protein p53 (TP53), and Neurogenic locus notch homolog protein (NOTCH), contribute to the development of different tumor types, each exhibiting distinct morphological and phenotypic features that can be observed at a microscopic level. However, identifying genetic abnormalities for targeted therapy often requires invasive procedures, prompting exploration into non-invasive approaches like radiogenomics. This study explores the utility of radiogenomics and machine learning (ML) in predicting these oncogenic signaling pathways in GBM patients. We collected post-operative MRI scans (T1w, T1c, FLAIR, T2w) from the BRATS-19 dataset, including scans from patients with both GBM and LGG, linked to genetic and clinical data via TCGA and CPTAC. Signaling pathway data was manually extracted from cBioPortal. Radiomic features were extracted from four MRI modalities using PyRadiomics. Dimensionality reduction and feature selection were applied and Data imbalance was addressed with SMOTE. Five ML models were trained to predict signaling pathways, with Grid Search optimizing hyperparameters and 5-fold cross-validation ensuring unbiased performance. Each model's performance was evaluated using various metrics on test data. Our results showed a positive association between most signaling pathways and the radiomic features derived from MRI scans. The best models achieved high AUC scores, namely 0.7 for RTK-RAS, 0.8 for PI3K, 0.75 for TP53, and 0.4 for NOTCH, and therefore, demonstrated the potential of ML models in accurately predicting oncogenic signaling pathways from radiomic features, thereby informing personalized therapeutic approaches and improving patient outcomes. We present a novel approach for the non-invasive prediction of deregulation in oncogenic signaling pathways in glioblastoma (GBM) by integrating radiogenomic data with machine learning models. This research contributes to advancing precision medicine in GBM management, highlighting the importance of integrating radiomics with genomic data to understand tumor behavior and treatment response better.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Non-canonical mutations such as BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>, found in 1-2% of GBMs, activate the MEK-ERK signaling pathway. This mutation can be targeted by small molecule inhibitors, offering therapeutic potential for GBM. In this case report, we describe the management of a 67-year-old male with BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> -mutant GBM, who experienced both local clonal and distant non-clonal BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> -mutant recurrences. Initial treatment involved surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and temozolomide (TMZ). Subsequent recurrences were managed with re-resection and dabrafenib/trametinib combination therapy. Notably, a new, non-clonal BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> -negative tumor developed in a distant location, highlighting the challenge of clonal evolution and resistance in GBM management. The patient's disease ultimately progressed despite multiple lines of therapy, including targeted inhibition. Identifying mechanisms of resistance and tailoring flexible treatment approaches are essential for advancing outcomes in BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> -mutant GBM. This case emphasizes the value of molecular profiling in personalizing treatment for patients with multifocal disease. The evolving nature of these tumors requires persistent clinical monitoring and treatment adjustments based on tissue diagnostics.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors show promise in cancer therapy, yet their efficacy in glioblastomas, particularly with IDH1 mutations, remains unclear. This study analyzed two independent NGS datasets (n = 577 and n = 153) from TCGA to investigate the expression of PDCD1 and CD274 in glioblastomas and their relationship with IDH1 mutations. We used cBioPortal for mutation analysis, RNA seq for expression analysis, miRDB and miRabel for differential expression of miRNAs, and Kaplan-Meier for survival prediction. We found that 5.4% of glioblastomas harbored IDH1 mutations, correlating with improved overall survival (OS) (p = 2.196e-3). Different glioblastoma cohorts showed a diverse IDH1 mutational prevalence (4-31%). Despite this, IDH1<sup>Mu</sup> was consistently associated with better OS (p = 8.235e-5). Notably, PDCD1 and CD274 were statistically significantly highly expressed in both IDH1<sup>Wt</sup> (p < 0.0001) and IDH1<sup>Mu</sup> tumors (p < 0.0001), with higher expression linked to poorer survival outcomes (PDCD1: p = 0.009; CD274: p = 0.02). Differential co-expression analyses revealed distinct gene and miRNA profiles for IDH1<sup>Wt</sup> and IDH1<sup>Mu</sup> glioblastomas, with specific upregulation of PTEN and downregulation of MUC16 in IDH1<sup>Wt</sup>, and upregulation of PIK3R1 in IDH1<sup>Mu</sup>. Additionally, PIK3R1 and ITGB2 emerged as critical druggable targets. Our findings indicate that PDCD1 and CD274 are highly expressed irrespective of IDH1 mutation statuses, suggesting that glioblastomas could benefit from immunotherapy. Moreover, IDH1<sup>Mu</sup> glioblastomas may require a combination of PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors and immunotherapy due to PIK3R1 overexpression.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

We focused on multi-habitat deep image descriptors as our basic focus. A subset of the BRATS 2021 MGMT methylation dataset containing both MGMT class labels and segmentation masks was used. A comprehensive mask fusion approach was developed to select relevant image crops of diseased tissue. These fusion masks, which were guided by multiple sequences, helped collect information from the regions that seem disease-free to radiologists in standard MRI sequences while harboring pathology. Integrating the information in different MRI sequences and leveraging the high entropic capacity of deep neural networks, we built a 3D ROI-based custom CNN classifier for the automatic prediction of MGMT methylation status of glioblastoma in multi-parametric MRI. Single sequence-based classifiers reached intermediate predictive performance with 0.65, 0.71, 0.77, and 0.82 accuracy for T1W, T2W, T1 contrast-enhanced, and FLAIR sequences, respectively. The multiparametric classifier using T1 contrast-enhanced and FLAIR images reached 0.88 accuracy. The accuracy of the four-input model that used all sequences was 0.81. The best model reached 0.90 ROC AUC value. Integrating human knowledge in the form of relevant target selection was a useful approach in MGMT methylation status prediction in MRI. Exploration of means to integrate radiology knowledge into the models and achieve human-machine collaboration may help to develop better models. MGMT methylation status of glioblastoma is an important prognostic marker and is also important for treatment decisions. The preoperative non-invasive predictive ability and the explanation tools of the developed model may help clinicians to better understand imaging phenotypes of MGMT methylation status of glial tumors.\n\nConsider:\n1.

In the following 20 years, it has lived up to expectations. A substantial body of evidence has demonstrated that it is closely related to the development, metastasis, migration, and drug resistance of malignant tumors. In recent years, research on the MSI protein has advanced, and many novel viewpoints and drug resistance attempts have been derived; for example, tumor protein p53 mutations and MSI-binding proteins lead to resistance to protein arginine N-methyltransferase 5-targeted therapy in lymphoma patients. Moreover, the high expression of MSI2 in pancreatic cancer might suppress its development and progression. As a significant member of the MSI family, MSI2 is closely associated with multiple malignant tumors, including hematological disorders, common abdominal tumors, and other tumor types (e.g., glioblastoma, breast cancer). MSI2 is highly expressed in the majority of tumors and is related to a poor disease prognosis. However, its specific expression levels and regulatory mechanisms may differ based on the tumor type. This review summarizes the research progress related to MSI2 in recent years, including its occurrence, migration mechanism, and drug resistance, as well as the prospect of developing tumor immunosuppressants and biomarkers.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Key metabolic pathways, including glycolysis, lactate production, and lipid metabolism, are upregulated to sustain tumor survival in the hypoxic and nutrient-deprived tumor microenvironment (TME), while glutamine and tryptophan metabolism further contribute to the aggressive phenotype of GBM. These metabolic alterations impair immune cell function, leading to exhaustion and stress in CD8+ and CD4+ T cells while favoring immunosuppressive populations such as regulatory T cells (Tregs) and M2-like macrophages. Recent studies emphasize the role of slow-cycling GBM cells (SCCs), lipid-laden macrophages, and tumor-associated astrocytes (TAAs) in reshaping GBM's metabolic landscape and reinforcing immune evasion. Genetic mutations, including <i>Isocitrate Dehydrogenase</i> (<i>IDH</i>) mutations, <i>Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor</i> (<i>EGFR</i>) amplification, and <i>Phosphotase and Tensin Homolog</i> (<i>PTEN</i>) loss, further drive metabolic reprogramming and offer potential targets for therapy. Understanding the relationship between GBM metabolism and immune suppression is critical for overcoming therapeutic resistance. This review focuses on the role of metabolic rewiring in GBM, its impact on the immune microenvironment, and the potential of combining metabolic targeting with immunotherapy to improve clinical outcomes for GBM patients.\n\nConsider:\n1.

This study identified detectable oncogene fusions in glioma patients through an integrated analysis of genomic and transcriptomic data, which encompassed whole exon sequencing and next-generation RNA sequencing. In addition, this study also conducted a comparison of the genetic characteristics, tumor microenvironment, mutation burden and survival between glioma patients with or without gene fusions. A total of 68 glioma patients were enrolled in this study, including glioblastoma (GBM), low grade glioma (LGG) and diffuse midline glioma (DMG). 14 cases of GBM patients (51.9%, 14/27) were found to harbor the following 70 oncogenic gene fusions: ROS1 (n\u2009=\u20098), NTRK (n\u2009=\u20095), KIF5 (n\u2009=\u20095), RET (n\u2009=\u20093) and other infrequent gene fusions (n\u2009=\u200949). A total of 11 gene fusions were identified in 8 LGG patients (32.0%, 8/25) and seven gene fusions were identified in one DMG patient (16.7%, 1/6). In GBM patient group, five genes including HOXA3, ACTB, CDK5, GNA12 and CARD11 exhibited a statistically significant higher copy number amplification frequency in the GBM group without gene fusions compared to that in the GBM group with gene fusions. In LGG patient group, CDK5 gene was also found to exhibit a statistically significant higher amplification frequency in the LGG group without gene fusions. In addition, KMT2D exhibited a statistically significant higher mutation frequency in the LGG group with gene fusions compared to that in the LGG group without gene fusions. Comparison of the other genetic characteristics including immune cell infiltration score, tumor mutation burden (TMB), and microsatellite instability (MSI). The results showed no statistically significant differences were observed between fusion and non-fusion group of GBM and LGG. The survival analysis revealed that GBM patients without gene fusions exhibited a longer median survival (737\xa0days) compared to GBM patients with gene fusions (642\xa0days), but without a statistical significancy. Our study has identified a set of gene fusions present in gliomas, including a number of novel gene fusions that have not been previously reported. We have also elucidated the underlying genetic characteristics of glioma with gene fusions. Collectively, our findings have the potential to inform future clinical treatment strategies for patients with glioma.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

Here, this study develops engineered GBM organoids (eGBOs) harboring GBM subtype-specific oncogenic mutations to investigate the underlying transcriptional regulation of tumor progression. Single-cell and spatial transcriptomic analyses revealed that these mutations disrupt normal neurodevelopment gene regulatory networks resulting in changes in cellular composition and spatial organization. Upon xenotransplantation into immunodeficient mice, eGBOs form tumors that recapitulate the transcriptional and spatial landscape of human GBM samples. Integrative single-cell trajectory analysis of both eGBO-derived tumor cells and patient GBM samples reveal the dynamic gene expression changes in developmental cell states underlying tumor progression. This analysis of eGBOs provides an important validation of engineered cancer organoid models and demonstrates their utility as a model of GBM tumorigenesis for future preclinical development of therapeutics.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Although the survival is generally dismal for glioblastoma patients, risk stratification and the identification of high-risk subgroups is important for prompt and aggressive management. The G1-G7 molecular subgroup classification based on the MAPK pathway activation has offered for the first time a non-redundant, all-inclusive classification of adult glioblastoma. Five patients from the large, 218-patient, prospective cohort showed germline mutations in mismatch repair (MMR) genes (Lynch syndrome) and a significantly worse median survival of 3.25 months post-surgery than those from the G1/EGFR and G3/NF1 major subgroups, or from the rest of the cohort adjusted for age. These rare tumors were assigned to a new subgroup, G3/MMR, a G3/NF1 subgroup spin-off, as they generally show genomic alterations leading to RAS activation, such as <i>NF1</i> and <i>PTPN11</i> mutations. An integrated clinical, histologic and molecular analysis of the G3/MMR tumors showed distinct characteristics as compared to other glioblastomas, including those with iatrogenic high tumor mutation burden (TMB), warranting a separate subgroup. Prior history of cancer, midline location or multifocality, presence of multinucleated giant cells (MGCs), positive p53 and MMR immunohistochemistry, and specific molecular characteristics, including high TMB, <i>MSH2</i>/<i>MSH6</i> alterations, biallelic <i>TP53</i> Arg mutations and co-occurring <i>PIK3CA</i> p.R88Q and <i>PTEN</i> alterations, alert to this high-risk G3/MMR subgroup. The MGCs and p53 immunohistochemistry analysis in G1-G7 subgroups showed that one in 7 tumors with these characteristics is a G3/MMR glioblastoma. The FDA-approved first-line therapy for many advanced solid tumors consists of nivolumab-ipilimumab immune checkpoint inhibitors. One G3/MMR patient received this regimen and survived much longer than the rest, setting a proof-of-principle example for the treatment of these very aggressive G3/MMR glioblastomas.\n\nConsider:\n1.

The vNAR R426 was characterized through molecular docking, molecular dynamics, and immunofluorescence staining, confirming its specificity for EGFRvIII. Functionally, vNAR R426 was conjugated with cisplatin and tested in the U87-MG glioma cell line. The cisplatin-vNAR complex demonstrated significantly greater cytotoxicity than free cisplatin at 72 hours (p < 0.05). Mechanistically, it enhanced drug delivery via receptor-mediated endocytosis and COPI-mediated nuclear translocation of EGFRvIII, improving cisplatin\'s efficacy. These findings suggest that vNAR R426 could serve as an effective targeted therapy for EGFRvIII-positive GBM, potentially enhancing treatment outcomes. However, further in vivo validation is needed before clinical application.\n\nArticle PMID:39919036\n### Focused Summary  \n\n#### **Main Findings and Conclusions:**  \nThis study highlights the influence of **TP53 status, MGMT expression, and differentiation state** on GBM treatment response. **TP53 mutations** significantly altered transcriptional responses to radiation (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ), while **wildtype (wt) TP53 GBM cells exhibited treatment-dependent modulation.** The **NF-κB pathway correlated with MGMT protein levels**, contributing to TMZ resistance **independent of MGMT promoter methylation status.** Additionally, differentiation of GBM cancer stem cells (CSCs) led to **increased TMZ resistance but not RT resistance**, involving activation of **BMP-Smad signaling and extracellular matrix components.**  \n\n#### **Methodology Overview:**  \nThe study utilized a **multi-omics approach** (proteomics, transcriptomics, genomics, and DNA methylation profiling) to analyze **patient-derived GBM CSCs** under astrocytic differentiation and treatment with RT and TMZ. The study assessed **stemness gene expression, survival pathways, and DNA damage-associated interferon (IFN) responses** across different genomic backgrounds.  \n\n#### **Population Characteristics:**  \nThe study examined **a panel of GBM patient-derived CSC models** representing diverse **genomic and molecular subtypes** to capture intratumoral heterogeneity. Specific mutation statuses (e.g., **TP53, MGMT methylation**) were analyzed in both **mutant and wildtype contexts.**  \n\n#### **Key Statistical Results:**  \n- **TP53 status** significantly influenced transcriptional responses to RT and TMZ.  \n- **NF-κB activation correlated with MGMT protein levels (p < 0.05),** indicating a potential resistance mechanism independent of MGMT promoter methylation.  \n- **Differentiated CSCs exhibited increased TMZ resistance** but retained RT sensitivity across all models.  \n- **DNA-damage-associated IFN response** was activated in both mutant and wt TP53 models.  \n\n#### **Clinical Implications:**  \n- **TP53 mutations may alter sensitivity to RT and TMZ**, requiring tailored therapeutic approaches.  \n- **NF-κB inhibition could be a potential strategy** to overcome TMZ resistance, even in MGMT-methylated tumors.  \n- **Differentiation state impacts TMZ efficacy,** suggesting that targeting CSC plasticity may improve treatment outcomes.  \n- Findings support **personalized GBM treatment strategies** based on molecular profiling,\n\nProvide a comprehensive synthesis that:\n1.

Conventional methods for assessing MGMT promoter methylation, such as methylation-specific PCR, are invasive and require tissue sampling. <b>Methods</b>: A comprehensive literature search was performed in compliance with the updated PRISMA 2020 guidelines within electronic databases MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, and IEEE Xplore. Search terms, including "MGMT", "methylation", "glioma", "glioblastoma", "machine learning", "deep learning", and "radiomics", were adopted in various MeSH combinations. Original studies in the English, Italian, German, and French languages were considered for inclusion. <b>Results</b>: This review analyzed 34 studies conducted in the last six years, focusing on assessing MGMT methylation status using radiomics (RD), deep learning (DL), or combined approaches. These studies utilized radiological data from the public (e.g., BraTS, TCGA) and private institutional datasets. Sixteen studies focused exclusively on glioblastoma (GBM), while others included low- and high-grade gliomas. Twenty-seven studies reported diagnostic accuracy, with fourteen achieving values above 80%. The combined use of DL and RD generally resulted in higher accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, although some studies reported lower minimum accuracy compared to studies using a single model. <b>Conclusions:</b> The integration of RD and DL offers a powerful, non-invasive tool for precisely recognizing MGMT promoter methylation status in gliomas, paving the way for enhanced personalized medicine in neuro-oncology. The heterogeneity of study populations, data sources, and methodologies reflected the complexity of the pipeline and machine learning algorithms, which may require general standardization to be implemented in clinical practice.\n\nConsider:\n1.

High levels of EGFR expression and mutations have been found in many GB patients, making the EGFR an attractive target for therapeutic treatment. The EGFRvIII mutant is the most studied, it is not found in normal cells and is positively associated with tumor cell aggressiveness and poor patient prognosis, not to mention there is a possibility of it being a tumor stem cell marker. Some anti-EGFR DNA aptamers have already been selected, including the aptamer U2. The goal of this study was to construct a more stable derivative of the aptamer U2, while not ruining its functional potential toward cell cultures from GB patients. A multiloop motif in a putative secondary structure of the aptamer U2 was taken as a key feature to design a novel minimal aptamer, Gol1, using molecular dynamics simulations for predicted 3D models. It turned out that the aptamer Gol1 has a similar putative secondary structure, with G-C base pairs providing its stability. The anti-proliferative activities of the aptamer Gol1 were assessed using patient-derived GB continuous cell cultures, G01 and BU881, with different abundances of EGFR and EGFRvIII. The transcriptome data for the cell culture G01, after aptamer Gol1 treatment, revealed significant changes in gene expression; it induced the transcription of genes associated with neurogenesis and cell differentiation, and it decreased the transcription of genes mediating key nuclear processes. There were significant changes in the gene transcription of key pro-oncogenic signaling pathways mediated by the EGFR. Therefore, the aptamer Gol1 could potentially be an efficient molecule for translation into biomedicine, in order to develop targeted therapy for GB patients.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Resistance to chemotherapy, particularly temozolomide (TMZ), is a significant challenge. The DNA repair enzyme MGMT and glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) often mediate this resistance. Recent studies highlight the therapeutic potential of natural compounds, particularly delphinidins, found in deep purple berries. Delphinidins are known for their ability to inhibit NF-κB signaling, a critical pathway for GB progression, chemoresistance, and MGMT expression. Our research demonstrates that glycosylated delphinidins have potential adjuvant use in the treatment of GB, offering a promising natural strategy to combat TMZ resistance. Specifically, we observed that delphinidin 3,5 di-glucoside has potent anticancer effects when used alone. Meanwhile, delphinidin 3 glucoside acted in synergy with temozolomide to decrease cell viability, highlighting its potential as an adjuvant. It also exerted a faster and more sustained inhibition of NF-κB, highlighting its potential for long-lasting therapeutic effects. These findings open new avenues for targeted therapies against glioblastoma, particularly to overcome treatment resistance.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

In this study, we employed an integrative multi-omics approach, including targeted proteomics, transcriptomics, genomics, and DNA methylation profiling, to investigate the response of a representative panel of GBM patient-derived cancer stem cells (CSCs) to astrocytic differentiation and RT and TMZ treatments. Differentiated CSC progenies retained the expression of key stemness genes and survival pathways, while activating the BMP-Smad signaling pathway and upregulating extracellular matrix components. This was associated with increased resistance to TMZ, though not to RT, across all models. We identified TP53 status as a critical determinant of transcriptional response to both RT and TMZ, which was also modulated by the differentiation state and treatment modality in wildtype (wt) p53 GBM cells. Both mutant and wt p53 models exhibited significant activation of the DNA-damage associated interferon (IFN) response in CSCs and differentiated cells, implicating this pathway in the GBM response to therapy. We observed that activation of NF-κB was positively correlated with the levels of O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) protein, a direct DNA repair enzyme leading to TMZ resistance, regardless of MGMT promoter methylation status, further supporting the clinical potential for inhibition of NF-kB signaling in GBM treatment. Our integrative analysis of the impact of GBM cell developmental states, in the context of genomic and molecular diversity of patient-derived models, provides valuable insights for pre-clinical studies aimed at optimizing treatment strategies.\n\nConsider:\n1.

N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification plays a critical role in the development of brain tumor. WTAP and ZC3H13 have been identified across various species. Immune contexture, which includes the tumor microenvironment (TME), plays a significant role in cancer progression and treatment. This study aimed to explore the potential impact between WTAP and ZC3H13 on the immunological characteristics of GBM. We utilized data from TCGA-GBM, GEO and CGGA datasets to obtain platform and probe data. Patients with GBM were stratified into two clusters based on the expression of WTAP and ZC3H13 using consensus clustering approach. Immune infiltration within the tumor microenvironment was assessed using ESTIMATE, CIBERSORT and ssGSEA methodologies. Functional disparities were determined through gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Tumor mutation burden (TMB) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) were also analyzed. Co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to identify genes associated with WTAP/ZC3H13 and immunity. Validation was performed using GEO and CGGA datasets. Our analysis revealed that cluster1 exhibited higher WTAP expression but lower ZC3H13 expression compared to cluster2. Cluster1 showed higher levels of immune infiltration and TMB compared to cluster2. WGCNA identified 15 genes closely associated with WTAP/ZC3H13 expression and immune scores, notably CTLA4, CD27, ICOS, and LAG3. Our results suggested that WTAP and ZC3H13 influence on immune contexture of GBM, providing new insights into tumor immunity in GBM.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

Here, we assessed the prevalence of MGMT methylation status among GBM patients in the United States. Additionally, we evaluated treatment practices and survival outcomes of GBM patients according to MGMT promoter methylation status. The National Cancer Database was queried to identify all adult U.S. patients (≥\u200918 years) diagnosed with IDH-wildtype GBM between 2018 and 2020. Treatment regimen was grouped into no chemotherapy and no radiotherapy, chemotherapy alone (without radiotherapy), radiotherapy alone (without chemotherapy), and chemoradiotherapy (chemotherapy and radiotherapy). Survival data were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves, log-rank tests, and multivariable Cox proportional hazard modeling. A total of 20,734 patients were included, of whom 6,404 (30.9%) had MGMT-methylated GBM, 9,065 (43.7%) had MGMT-unmethylated tumors, and 5,265 (25.4%) had unknown methylation status. The median and three-year overall survival were 12.4 months and 15.5%, respectively, for the entire cohort (16.4 months and 23.9% for MGMT-methylated patients and 11.8 months and 9.8% for MGMT-unmethylated patients, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Chemoradiotherapy was less commonly used for elderly (≥\u200970 years, 58.5%) than non-elderly (<\u200970 years, 79.2%) patients. Among elderly patients, radiotherapy alone was more commonly administered than chemotherapy alone for patients with MGMT-unmethylated tumors (11.2% vs. 2.1%) and MGMT-methylated tumors (6.6% vs. 3.9%). However, chemotherapy alone was associated with a lower mortality risk (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.51-0.99, p\u2009=\u20090.04) than radiotherapy alone for elderly patients with MGMT-methylated tumors, while chemotherapy alone was associated with a higher mortality risk (HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.09-2.44, p\u2009=\u20090.02) than radiotherapy alone for elderly patients with MGMT-unmethylated tumors. Patients who were elderly, uninsured, insured through Medicaid, lived in zip codes with lower median education levels, or received care at non-academic programs were less likely to undergo MGMT testing. A high proportion of GBM patients in the United States undergo MGMT promoter testing, though significant sociodemographic disparities exist. While there was a decrease in chemoradiotherapy use with increasing age, radiotherapy alone was more commonly administered to elderly patients than chemotherapy alone irrespective of MGMT promoter methylation status.\n\nConsider:\n1.

It may be happened because of drug resistance against their typical receptors, since these receptor genes are often mutated by environmental stress. So identifying mutated oncodriver genes which could be used as potential drug target is essential in order to develop effective new therapeutic drugs as well as better prognosis for GBM patients. In this study, we analyzed whole exome sequencing (WES) profiles of NCBI database on GBM and matched-normal (control) samples originated from astrocyte like neural stem cells (NSC) of subventricular zone (SVZ) to explore GBM-causing mutated oncodriver genes, since SVZ is considered as the origin of GBM development. We detected 16 mutated oncodriver genes. Then, filtering by differential co-expression analysis based on independent RNA-Seq profiles of CGGA database revealed 10 genes as dysregulated oncodriver genes. Following that, 3 significantly overexpressed oncodriver genes (MTCH2, VWF, and WDR89) were identified as potential drug targets. Then molecular mechanisms of GBM development were investigated by these three overexpressed driver genes through gene ontology (GO), KEGG-pathways, Gene regulatory network (GRN) and mutation analysis. Finally, overexpressed oncodriver genes guided top-ranked six drug agents (Irinotecan, Imatinib, etoposide, pazopanib, trametinib and cabozanitinib) were recommended against GBM through molecular docking study. Most of our findings received support by the literature review also.

We analyzed the frequency of PD-L1 expression in glioma samples. Methodology In this two-year retrospective study, 45 glioma cases of varying grades (grades 2 to 4) were examined at a tertiary care hospital. Tumor samples that were formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) were obtained from the pathology archives of the hospital. According to the WHO Classification of Central Nervous System Tumors, 5th edition, tumor grading and histopathological subtyping were carried out. PD-L1 antibody (clone 28-8) and IDH1 (R132H, clone QM002, Quartett Immunodiagnostika, 1:100 dilution) markers were used for immunohistochemistry (IHC). The sections underwent deparaffinization, rehydration, and antigen retrieval using Leica bond III staining platform. Based on the tumor proportion score (TPS), which is the proportion of viable tumor cells with membranous staining, PD-L1 expression was assessed. The literature's standardized cut-off values were used to determine positive expression. Staining intensity and tumor cell location were used to determine the status of IDH1 mutations. Age, sex, and tumor location were among the clinical and demographic information gathered about the patient. The association between PD-L1 expression, glioma grades, and IDH1 (R132H) mutation status was assessed statistically using SPSS software and a Chi-square test. The threshold for statistical significance was p < 0.05. For every IHC run, positive and negative controls were used as part of the quality control procedures. To reduce bias and guarantee consistency, two pathologists and post graduate residents independently reviewed the results. Results PD-L1 expression was found in 27 out of 36 (75%) grade 4 glioblastoma multiforme cases and six out of nine (66.7%) grade 2 gliomas. Overall, 33/45 (73.3%) of the gliomas had PD-L1 expression. However, PD-L1 expression and glioma grade did not correlate in a statistically significant way. IDH1 (R132H) expression and PD-L1 were found to be inversely correlated (p < 0.05). Conclusion The findings suggest that PD-L1 may be a promising therapeutic target, even in the absence of significant grade-specific trends by\xa0demonstrating PD-L1 presence in the majority of glioma cases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in GBM immunotherapy. The results provide insight into the immune landscape of gliomas and pave the way for future research into effective combination therapies for GBM, despite the lack of a significant correlation between glioma grade and PD-L1 expression.\n\nConsider:\n1.

This study aims to develop a comprehensive prognostic model to identify biomarkers associated with temozolomide (TMZ) resistance. We employed a multifaceted approach, combining differential expression and univariate Cox regression analyses to screen for TMZ resistance-related differentially expressed genes (TMZR-RDEGs) in GBM. Using LASSO Cox analysis, we selected 12 TMZR-RDEGs to construct a risk score model, which was evaluated for performance through survival analysis, time-dependent ROC, and stratified analyses. Functional enrichment and mutation analyses were conducted to explore the underlying mechanisms of the risk score and its relationship with immune cell infiltration levels in GBM. The prognostic risk score model, based on the 12 TMZR-RDEGs, demonstrated high efficacy in predicting GBM patient outcomes and emerged as an independent predictive factor. Additionally, we focused on the molecule TSPAN13, whose role in GBM is not well understood. We assessed cell proliferation, migration, and invasion capabilities through in vitro assays (including CCK-8, Edu, wound healing, and transwell assays) and quantitatively analyzed TSPAN13 expression levels in clinical glioma samples using tissue microarray immunohistochemistry. The impact of TSPAN13 on TMZ resistance in GBM cells was validated through in vitro experiments and a mouse orthotopic xenograft model. Notably, TSPAN13 was upregulated in GBM and correlated with poorer patient prognosis. Knockdown of TSPAN13 inhibited GBM cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and enhanced sensitivity to TMZ treatment. This study provides a valuable prognostic tool for GBM and identifies TSPAN13 as a critical target for therapeutic intervention.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

Here, we characterized 5 murine GBM stem-like cell (mGSC) models derived from lentivirus-induced tumors in transgenic mice that are driven by the activation of the Nf1-Ras signaling pathway and inactivation of Tp53. MGSC lines (005, RIG, NF53, C1, and C3) were cultured as spheres in serum-free stem cell media. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was employed to quantify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Stem cell properties were characterized by stemness in vitro and tumorigenicity after intracerebral implantation in C57BL/6 mice. Tumor phenotypes and the immune microenvironment were characterized by immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and RNA sequencing. WES revealed a large variation in coding sequence SNPs across mGSC lines (~20-fold), likely influenced by the mixed backgrounds of the parental mice. MGSCs exhibited variable clonogenic sphere formation and CD133 expression levels. In vivo, they consistently initiated lethal malignant gliomas, with median survival ranging from 29 to 82 days, and showed strong CD44 expression and variable invasiveness. The tumor microenvironment featured an abundance of CD68+ macrophages and uniform high PD-L1+ myeloid cells, while T-cell infiltration varied among the models, with low mutation burden C1 and C3 exhibiting fewer tumor-infiltrating T cells. Upon orthotopic implantation in immunocompetent mice, mGSCs generate tumors characteristic of human GBM. Despite similar strategies to generate these mGSCs, they exhibited a range of phenotypes and immune profiles in mGSC-derived orthotopic tumors. These mGSCs provide new preclinical GBM models for developing GBM immunotherapies.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2. Study type and methodology\n3. Population characteristics\n4.

HNF1B is a critical transcription element in vertebrate proliferation and oncogenesis, which has been shown to play roles in reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism. Our previous results have identified HNF1B as a tumor suppressor that could inhibit the malignant progression of prostate cancer. Yet there is no pan-carcinomatosis analysis of HNF1B, which could help us better understand common and unique underlying mechanisms in mankind knubs to enhance novel and competent treatment. Here, in our research, we evaluated the utterance pattern and explored the function of HNF1B in 33 knub categories using the data from the Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and CLNICAL PROTEOMICTUMOR ANALYSIS CONSORTIUM (CPTAC) dataset. We found different HNF1B roles in various cancer types. HNF1B was upregulated in CHOL, STAD, KIRP, and THCA, and was downregulated in GBM, KICH, COAD, KIRC, LUSC, SARC, PAAD, and TGCT. Prognostic analyses indicated that higher HNF1B displayed better illness outcomes in BLCA, READ, and PRAD, while poorer outcomes in LUSC and THYM. HNF1B mutation was most frequent in endometrial cancer but was not associated with disease prognosis. It was discovered that HNF1B utterance relevant to endothelial cell penetration status in BLCA, ESCA, LUAD, LUSC, and TGCT, and carcinomatosis-associated fibroblast infiltration was observed in ESCA, KIRC, LIHC, and TGCT. Moreover, functional enrichment analysis disclosed that metabolism-related functions were implicated in the function of HNF1B. Taken together, our pan- carcinomatosis analysis showed the complicated roles of HNF1B in a variety of carcinomatoses, being able to improve the extensive comprehension of HNF1B's role in tumorigenesis.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Reduced expression of the MGMT gene (10q26.3), influenced primarily by the methylation of two differentially methylated regions (DMR1 and DMR2), is associated with a good response to temozolomide treatment. However, suitable methods for detecting the methylation of the MGMT gene promoter and setting appropriate cutoff values are debated. A cohort of 108 patients with histologically and genetically defined glioblastoma was retrospectively examined with methylation-specific Sanger sequencing (sSeq) and methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA) methods. The DMR2 region was methylated in 29% of samples, whereas DMR1 was methylated in 12% of samples. Methylation detected with the MS-MLPA method using probes MGMT_215, MGMT_190, and MGMT_124 from the ME012-A1 kit (located in DMR1 and DMR2) correlated with the methylation of the corresponding CpG dinucleotides detected with sSeq (p\u2009=\u20090.005 for probe MGMT_215; p\u2009<\u20090.001 for probe MGMT_190; p\u2009=\u20090.016 for probe MGMT_124). The threshold for methylation detection with the MS-MLPA method was calculated with a ROC curve analysis and principal components analysis of the data obtained with the MS-MLPA and sSeq methods, yielding a weighted value of 0.362. Thus, methylation of the MGMT gene promoter was confirmed in 36% of samples. These patients had statistically significantly better overall survival (p\u2009=\u20090.003). Our results show that the threshold for methylation detection with the MS-MLPA method determined here is useful from a diagnostic perspective because it allows the stratification of patients who will benefit from specific treatment protocols, including temozolomide. Detailed analysis of the MGMT gene promoter enables the more-precise and personalized treatment of patients with glioblastoma.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

The survival rate remains low despite standard therapies, highlighting the urgent need for novel treatment strategies. Advanced imaging techniques, particularly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are crucial in assessing GBM. Disruptions in various oncogenic signaling pathways, such as Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK)-Ras-Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling, Phosphoinositide 3- Kinases (PI3Ks), tumor protein p53 (TP53), and Neurogenic locus notch homolog protein (NOTCH), contribute to the development of different tumor types, each exhibiting distinct morphological and phenotypic features that can be observed at a microscopic level. However, identifying genetic abnormalities for targeted therapy often requires invasive procedures, prompting exploration into non-invasive approaches like radiogenomics. This study explores the utility of radiogenomics and machine learning (ML) in predicting these oncogenic signaling pathways in GBM patients. We collected post-operative MRI scans (T1w, T1c, FLAIR, T2w) from the BRATS-19 dataset, including scans from patients with both GBM and LGG, linked to genetic and clinical data via TCGA and CPTAC. Signaling pathway data was manually extracted from cBioPortal. Radiomic features were extracted from four MRI modalities using PyRadiomics. Dimensionality reduction and feature selection were applied and Data imbalance was addressed with SMOTE. Five ML models were trained to predict signaling pathways, with Grid Search optimizing hyperparameters and 5-fold cross-validation ensuring unbiased performance. Each model's performance was evaluated using various metrics on test data. Our results showed a positive association between most signaling pathways and the radiomic features derived from MRI scans. The best models achieved high AUC scores, namely 0.7 for RTK-RAS, 0.8 for PI3K, 0.75 for TP53, and 0.4 for NOTCH, and therefore, demonstrated the potential of ML models in accurately predicting oncogenic signaling pathways from radiomic features, thereby informing personalized therapeutic approaches and improving patient outcomes. We present a novel approach for the non-invasive prediction of deregulation in oncogenic signaling pathways in glioblastoma (GBM) by integrating radiogenomic data with machine learning models. This research contributes to advancing precision medicine in GBM management, highlighting the importance of integrating radiomics with genomic data to understand tumor behavior and treatment response better.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Initial treatment involved surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and temozolomide (TMZ). Subsequent recurrences were managed with re-resection and dabrafenib/trametinib combination therapy. Notably, a new, non-clonal BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> -negative tumor developed in a distant location, highlighting the challenge of clonal evolution and resistance in GBM management.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors show promise in cancer therapy, yet their efficacy in glioblastomas, particularly with IDH1 mutations, remains unclear. This study analyzed two independent NGS datasets (n = 577 and n = 153) from TCGA to investigate the expression of PDCD1 and CD274 in glioblastomas and their relationship with IDH1 mutations. We used cBioPortal for mutation analysis, RNA seq for expression analysis, miRDB and miRabel for differential expression of miRNAs, and Kaplan-Meier for survival prediction. We found that 5.4% of glioblastomas harbored IDH1 mutations, correlating with improved overall survival (OS) (p = 2.196e-3). Different glioblastoma cohorts showed a diverse IDH1 mutational prevalence (4-31%). Despite this, IDH1<sup>Mu</sup> was consistently associated with better OS (p = 8.235e-5). Notably, PDCD1 and CD274 were statistically significantly highly expressed in both IDH1<sup>Wt</sup> (p < 0.0001) and IDH1<sup>Mu</sup> tumors (p < 0.0001), with higher expression linked to poorer survival outcomes (PDCD1: p = 0.009; CD274: p = 0.02). Differential co-expression analyses revealed distinct gene and miRNA profiles for IDH1<sup>Wt</sup> and IDH1<sup>Mu</sup> glioblastomas, with specific upregulation of PTEN and downregulation of MUC16 in IDH1<sup>Wt</sup>, and upregulation of PIK3R1 in IDH1<sup>Mu</sup>. Additionally, PIK3R1 and ITGB2 emerged as critical druggable targets. Our findings indicate that PDCD1 and CD274 are highly expressed irrespective of IDH1 mutation statuses, suggesting that glioblastomas could benefit from immunotherapy. Moreover, IDH1<sup>Mu</sup> glioblastomas may require a combination of PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors and immunotherapy due to PIK3R1 overexpression.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

We focused on multi-habitat deep image descriptors as our basic focus. A subset of the BRATS 2021 MGMT methylation dataset containing both MGMT class labels and segmentation masks was used. A comprehensive mask fusion approach was developed to select relevant image crops of diseased tissue. These fusion masks, which were guided by multiple sequences, helped collect information from the regions that seem disease-free to radiologists in standard MRI sequences while harboring pathology. Integrating the information in different MRI sequences and leveraging the high entropic capacity of deep neural networks, we built a 3D ROI-based custom CNN classifier for the automatic prediction of MGMT methylation status of glioblastoma in multi-parametric MRI. Single sequence-based classifiers reached intermediate predictive performance with 0.65, 0.71, 0.77, and 0.82 accuracy for T1W, T2W, T1 contrast-enhanced, and FLAIR sequences, respectively. The multiparametric classifier using T1 contrast-enhanced and FLAIR images reached 0.88 accuracy. The accuracy of the four-input model that used all sequences was 0.81. The best model reached 0.90 ROC AUC value. Integrating human knowledge in the form of relevant target selection was a useful approach in MGMT methylation status prediction in MRI. Exploration of means to integrate radiology knowledge into the models and achieve human-machine collaboration may help to develop better models. MGMT methylation status of glioblastoma is an important prognostic marker and is also important for treatment decisions. The preoperative non-invasive predictive ability and the explanation tools of the developed model may help clinicians to better understand imaging phenotypes of MGMT methylation status of glial tumors.\n\nConsider:\n1.

In the following 20 years, it has lived up to expectations. A substantial body of evidence has demonstrated that it is closely related to the development, metastasis, migration, and drug resistance of malignant tumors. In recent years, research on the MSI protein has advanced, and many novel viewpoints and drug resistance attempts have been derived; for example, tumor protein p53 mutations and MSI-binding proteins lead to resistance to protein arginine N-methyltransferase 5-targeted therapy in lymphoma patients. Moreover, the high expression of MSI2 in pancreatic cancer might suppress its development and progression. As a significant member of the MSI family, MSI2 is closely associated with multiple malignant tumors, including hematological disorders, common abdominal tumors, and other tumor types (e.g., glioblastoma, breast cancer). MSI2 is highly expressed in the majority of tumors and is related to a poor disease prognosis. However, its specific expression levels and regulatory mechanisms may differ based on the tumor type. This review summarizes the research progress related to MSI2 in recent years, including its occurrence, migration mechanism, and drug resistance, as well as the prospect of developing tumor immunosuppressants and biomarkers.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Key metabolic pathways, including glycolysis, lactate production, and lipid metabolism, are upregulated to sustain tumor survival in the hypoxic and nutrient-deprived tumor microenvironment (TME), while glutamine and tryptophan metabolism further contribute to the aggressive phenotype of GBM. These metabolic alterations impair immune cell function, leading to exhaustion and stress in CD8+ and CD4+ T cells while favoring immunosuppressive populations such as regulatory T cells (Tregs) and M2-like macrophages. Recent studies emphasize the role of slow-cycling GBM cells (SCCs), lipid-laden macrophages, and tumor-associated astrocytes (TAAs) in reshaping GBM's metabolic landscape and reinforcing immune evasion. Genetic mutations, including <i>Isocitrate Dehydrogenase</i> (<i>IDH</i>) mutations, <i>Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor</i> (<i>EGFR</i>) amplification, and <i>Phosphotase and Tensin Homolog</i> (<i>PTEN</i>) loss, further drive metabolic reprogramming and offer potential targets for therapy. Understanding the relationship between GBM metabolism and immune suppression is critical for overcoming therapeutic resistance. This review focuses on the role of metabolic rewiring in GBM, its impact on the immune microenvironment, and the potential of combining metabolic targeting with immunotherapy to improve clinical outcomes for GBM patients.\n\nConsider:\n1.

This study identified detectable oncogene fusions in glioma patients through an integrated analysis of genomic and transcriptomic data, which encompassed whole exon sequencing and next-generation RNA sequencing. In addition, this study also conducted a comparison of the genetic characteristics, tumor microenvironment, mutation burden and survival between glioma patients with or without gene fusions. A total of 68 glioma patients were enrolled in this study, including glioblastoma (GBM), low grade glioma (LGG) and diffuse midline glioma (DMG). 14 cases of GBM patients (51.9%, 14/27) were found to harbor the following 70 oncogenic gene fusions: ROS1 (n\u2009=\u20098), NTRK (n\u2009=\u20095), KIF5 (n\u2009=\u20095), RET (n\u2009=\u20093) and other infrequent gene fusions (n\u2009=\u200949). A total of 11 gene fusions were identified in 8 LGG patients (32.0%, 8/25) and seven gene fusions were identified in one DMG patient (16.7%, 1/6). In GBM patient group, five genes including HOXA3, ACTB, CDK5, GNA12 and CARD11 exhibited a statistically significant higher copy number amplification frequency in the GBM group without gene fusions compared to that in the GBM group with gene fusions. In LGG patient group, CDK5 gene was also found to exhibit a statistically significant higher amplification frequency in the LGG group without gene fusions. In addition, KMT2D exhibited a statistically significant higher mutation frequency in the LGG group with gene fusions compared to that in the LGG group without gene fusions. Comparison of the other genetic characteristics including immune cell infiltration score, tumor mutation burden (TMB), and microsatellite instability (MSI). The results showed no statistically significant differences were observed between fusion and non-fusion group of GBM and LGG. The survival analysis revealed that GBM patients without gene fusions exhibited a longer median survival (737\xa0days) compared to GBM patients with gene fusions (642\xa0days), but without a statistical significancy. Our study has identified a set of gene fusions present in gliomas, including a number of novel gene fusions that have not been previously reported. We have also elucidated the underlying genetic characteristics of glioma with gene fusions. Collectively, our findings have the potential to inform future clinical treatment strategies for patients with glioma.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

Although the survival is generally dismal for glioblastoma patients, risk stratification and the identification of high-risk subgroups is important for prompt and aggressive management. The G1-G7 molecular subgroup classification based on the MAPK pathway activation has offered for the first time a non-redundant, all-inclusive classification of adult glioblastoma. Five patients from the large, 218-patient, prospective cohort showed germline mutations in mismatch repair (MMR) genes (Lynch syndrome) and a significantly worse median survival of 3.25 months post-surgery than those from the G1/EGFR and G3/NF1 major subgroups, or from the rest of the cohort adjusted for age. These rare tumors were assigned to a new subgroup, G3/MMR, a G3/NF1 subgroup spin-off, as they generally show genomic alterations leading to RAS activation, such as <i>NF1</i> and <i>PTPN11</i> mutations. An integrated clinical, histologic and molecular analysis of the G3/MMR tumors showed distinct characteristics as compared to other glioblastomas, including those with iatrogenic high tumor mutation burden (TMB), warranting a separate subgroup. Prior history of cancer, midline location or multifocality, presence of multinucleated giant cells (MGCs), positive p53 and MMR immunohistochemistry, and specific molecular characteristics, including high TMB, <i>MSH2</i>/<i>MSH6</i> alterations, biallelic <i>TP53</i> Arg mutations and co-occurring <i>PIK3CA</i> p.R88Q and <i>PTEN</i> alterations, alert to this high-risk G3/MMR subgroup. The MGCs and p53 immunohistochemistry analysis in G1-G7 subgroups showed that one in 7 tumors with these characteristics is a G3/MMR glioblastoma. The FDA-approved first-line therapy for many advanced solid tumors consists of nivolumab-ipilimumab immune checkpoint inhibitors. One G3/MMR patient received this regimen and survived much longer than the rest, setting a proof-of-principle example for the treatment of these very aggressive G3/MMR glioblastomas.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Gliomas comprise high-grade gliomas like glioblastoma multiforme (GBMs), many of which have mutation in the tumor suppressor p53 gene and low-grade gliomas (LGGs). LGGs can progress to GBMs due to various factors. The available treatment options for GBMs and LGGs include surgical resection, radiation and chemotherapy. The chemotherapeutic drug available in the clinic is temozolomide (TMZ). However, TMZ can cause damage to DNA if taken for prolonged period. This warrants the discovery of drugs that would potentially elicit less adverse side effects while maintaining anticancer activity. To this end, we evaluated the impact of cinnamaldehyde (CA), a single, purified component of the natural product cinnamon. The elucidation of the mechanism of action revealed the impact of CA on reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Moreover, its effect on the extrinsic programmed cell death pathway resulted in the increase of apoptotic cell populations, invoking multicaspase. Notably, the cell survival/death pivotal molecule Bcl-2 was impacted. These effects were observed in both the types of brain tumor cells studied: GBMs, represented by U251 cells (p53 mutated cell line) and LGGs represented by H4 cells. Results from the current study suggest potential for CA as a therapeutic option as it is expected to have fewer adverse side effects due to it being a component of a natural product and possibly deter the progression of LGGs to GBMs.\n\nConsider:\n1.

While most recurrences are local, patients rarely present with a new discontiguous focus of glioblastoma. Little is currently known about the genetic profile of discontiguous recurrences. In our institutional database, we identified 22 patients with targeted exome sequencing of pairs of initial and recurrent IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. Recurrences were classified as contiguous or discontiguous based on the presence or absence of T2 FLAIR signal connection to the initial site of disease on MRI. Exome analysis revealed shared driver and passenger mutations between discontiguous recurrences and initial tumors, supporting a common origin. Discontiguous recurrences were more likely to be hypermutated compared to contiguous recurrences (p\u2009=\u20090.038). Analysis of 2 glioblastoma cases with discontiguous recurrence at a collaborating institution also exhibited hypermutation. In conclusion, discontiguous glioblastoma recurrences share a common origin with the initial tumor and are more likely to be hypermutated than contiguous recurrences.\n\nConsider:\n1.

This study aims to investigate key biomarkers of glioma-related hemorrhage to provide insights into glioma molecular therapies. Data were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases to analyze differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in glioma by contrasting glioblastoma (GBM) with low-grade gliomas (LGGs). We conducted enrichment analyses using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway and Gene Ontology (GO) databases through the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID). A STRING-based protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was developed to identify hub genes, which were subsequently analyzed for their functions in the GeneCards database. To identify angiogenesis-associated genes, we utilized the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) databases. A clinical pathological study was conducted using immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining to confirm the findings. In the GEO database, the GEO Series Experiments GSE26576 and GSE184941 included 4523 and 1471 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), respectively. We identified 2715 DEGs using the cBioPortal within the TCGA database. A Venn diagram identified 39 common DEGs. The KEGG pathways and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis highlighted functions related to angiogenesis. PPI network analyses pinpointed 13 hub genes. Through cross-referencing a gene set related to tumor angiogenesis in the GeneCards database, we identified MMP-2 and EGFR as key genes. In the HPA database, we observed EGFR and MMP-2 expression in the normal cerebral cortex, confirmed by IHC. In GEPIA database, high MMP-2 levels were associated with decreased survival time, while EGFR expression showed no significant differences in survival. A clinical study of 21 patients, 11 in the control group and 10 in the stroke group with glioma hemorrhage, revealed no significant differences in their characteristics or comorbidities. IDH1 positivity was higher in the control group (4/11) vs the stroke group (0/10). Tumor cells exhibited increased MMP-2 and EGFR expression, with stronger staining in the stroke group. Our study concluded that IDH1, MMP-2, and EGFR are implicated in the molecular mechanism of glioma hemorrhage as key biomarkers. MMP-2 and IDH1 are potential targets for molecular therapy.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2. Study type and methodology\n3. Population characteristics\n4.

The vNAR R426 effectively binds EGFRvIII and enhances cisplatin (CDDP) delivery, improving cytotoxic effects in GBM cells. The study highlights receptor-mediated endocytosis and COPI-mediated nuclear translocation as mechanisms enhancing drug efficacy.  \n\n#### **Methodology Overview**  \n- **Isolation & Characterization:** vNAR R426 was isolated from a non-immune stingray library and confirmed to bind EGFRvIII via molecular docking, molecular dynamics, and immunofluorescence staining.  \n- **Drug Delivery Assessment:** vNAR R426 was conjugated with cisplatin and tested in the U87-MG glioma cell line.  \n- **Efficacy Evaluation:** Cell viability assays compared the effects of cisplatin-vNAR vs. free cisplatin over 72 hours.  \n\n#### **Population Characteristics**  \n- **In vitro model:** U87-MG glioblastoma cell line, which does not naturally express EGFRvIII, suggesting possible transfection or engineered expression for this study.  \n\n#### **Key Statistical Results**  \n- The cisplatin-vNAR carrier showed **significantly greater cytotoxicity** than free cisplatin at 72 hours (exact numerical values not provided in the abstract).  \n- The study demonstrated **enhanced nuclear delivery** of cisplatin via EGFRvIII-mediated internalization.  \n\n#### **Clinical Implications**  \n- **Targeted Therapy:** vNAR R426 could improve cisplatin efficacy in EGFRvIII-positive GBM, reducing systemic toxicity.  \n- **Potential for Combination Treatment:** This approach may complement existing therapies, including immunotherapy and tumor-treating fields (TTF), by enhancing drug delivery.  \n- **Further Research Needed:** Preclinical and clinical trials are required to validate efficacy and safety in human GBM patients.  \n\nThis study supports the development of EGFRvIII-targeted drug carriers to improve glioblastoma treatment outcomes.\n\nProvide a comprehensive synthesis that:\n1.

Conventional methods for assessing MGMT promoter methylation, such as methylation-specific PCR, are invasive and require tissue sampling. <b>Methods</b>: A comprehensive literature search was performed in compliance with the updated PRISMA 2020 guidelines within electronic databases MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, and IEEE Xplore. Search terms, including "MGMT", "methylation", "glioma", "glioblastoma", "machine learning", "deep learning", and "radiomics", were adopted in various MeSH combinations. Original studies in the English, Italian, German, and French languages were considered for inclusion. <b>Results</b>: This review analyzed 34 studies conducted in the last six years, focusing on assessing MGMT methylation status using radiomics (RD), deep learning (DL), or combined approaches. These studies utilized radiological data from the public (e.g., BraTS, TCGA) and private institutional datasets. Sixteen studies focused exclusively on glioblastoma (GBM), while others included low- and high-grade gliomas. Twenty-seven studies reported diagnostic accuracy, with fourteen achieving values above 80%. The combined use of DL and RD generally resulted in higher accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, although some studies reported lower minimum accuracy compared to studies using a single model. <b>Conclusions:</b> The integration of RD and DL offers a powerful, non-invasive tool for precisely recognizing MGMT promoter methylation status in gliomas, paving the way for enhanced personalized medicine in neuro-oncology. The heterogeneity of study populations, data sources, and methodologies reflected the complexity of the pipeline and machine learning algorithms, which may require general standardization to be implemented in clinical practice.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Resistance to chemotherapy, particularly temozolomide (TMZ), is a significant challenge. The DNA repair enzyme MGMT and glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) often mediate this resistance. Recent studies highlight the therapeutic potential of natural compounds, particularly delphinidins, found in deep purple berries. Delphinidins are known for their ability to inhibit NF-κB signaling, a critical pathway for GB progression, chemoresistance, and MGMT expression. Our research demonstrates that glycosylated delphinidins have potential adjuvant use in the treatment of GB, offering a promising natural strategy to combat TMZ resistance. Specifically, we observed that delphinidin 3,5 di-glucoside has potent anticancer effects when used alone. Meanwhile, delphinidin 3 glucoside acted in synergy with temozolomide to decrease cell viability, highlighting its potential as an adjuvant. It also exerted a faster and more sustained inhibition of NF-κB, highlighting its potential for long-lasting therapeutic effects. These findings open new avenues for targeted therapies against glioblastoma, particularly to overcome treatment resistance.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

In this study, we employed an integrative multi-omics approach, including targeted proteomics, transcriptomics, genomics, and DNA methylation profiling, to investigate the response of a representative panel of GBM patient-derived cancer stem cells (CSCs) to astrocytic differentiation and RT and TMZ treatments. Differentiated CSC progenies retained the expression of key stemness genes and survival pathways, while activating the BMP-Smad signaling pathway and upregulating extracellular matrix components. This was associated with increased resistance to TMZ, though not to RT, across all models. We identified TP53 status as a critical determinant of transcriptional response to both RT and TMZ, which was also modulated by the differentiation state and treatment modality in wildtype (wt) p53 GBM cells. Both mutant and wt p53 models exhibited significant activation of the DNA-damage associated interferon (IFN) response in CSCs and differentiated cells, implicating this pathway in the GBM response to therapy. We observed that activation of NF-κB was positively correlated with the levels of O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) protein, a direct DNA repair enzyme leading to TMZ resistance, regardless of MGMT promoter methylation status, further supporting the clinical potential for inhibition of NF-kB signaling in GBM treatment. Our integrative analysis of the impact of GBM cell developmental states, in the context of genomic and molecular diversity of patient-derived models, provides valuable insights for pre-clinical studies aimed at optimizing treatment strategies.\n\nConsider:\n1.

N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification plays a critical role in the development of brain tumor. WTAP and ZC3H13 have been identified across various species. Immune contexture, which includes the tumor microenvironment (TME), plays a significant role in cancer progression and treatment. This study aimed to explore the potential impact between WTAP and ZC3H13 on the immunological characteristics of GBM. We utilized data from TCGA-GBM, GEO and CGGA datasets to obtain platform and probe data. Patients with GBM were stratified into two clusters based on the expression of WTAP and ZC3H13 using consensus clustering approach. Immune infiltration within the tumor microenvironment was assessed using ESTIMATE, CIBERSORT and ssGSEA methodologies. Functional disparities were determined through gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Tumor mutation burden (TMB) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) were also analyzed. Co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to identify genes associated with WTAP/ZC3H13 and immunity. Validation was performed using GEO and CGGA datasets. Our analysis revealed that cluster1 exhibited higher WTAP expression but lower ZC3H13 expression compared to cluster2. Cluster1 showed higher levels of immune infiltration and TMB compared to cluster2. WGCNA identified 15 genes closely associated with WTAP/ZC3H13 expression and immune scores, notably CTLA4, CD27, ICOS, and LAG3. Our results suggested that WTAP and ZC3H13 influence on immune contexture of GBM, providing new insights into tumor immunity in GBM.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

Here, we assessed the prevalence of MGMT methylation status among GBM patients in the United States. Additionally, we evaluated treatment practices and survival outcomes of GBM patients according to MGMT promoter methylation status. The National Cancer Database was queried to identify all adult U.S. patients (≥\u200918 years) diagnosed with IDH-wildtype GBM between 2018 and 2020. Treatment regimen was grouped into no chemotherapy and no radiotherapy, chemotherapy alone (without radiotherapy), radiotherapy alone (without chemotherapy), and chemoradiotherapy (chemotherapy and radiotherapy). Survival data were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves, log-rank tests, and multivariable Cox proportional hazard modeling. A total of 20,734 patients were included, of whom 6,404 (30.9%) had MGMT-methylated GBM, 9,065 (43.7%) had MGMT-unmethylated tumors, and 5,265 (25.4%) had unknown methylation status. The median and three-year overall survival were 12.4 months and 15.5%, respectively, for the entire cohort (16.4 months and 23.9% for MGMT-methylated patients and 11.8 months and 9.8% for MGMT-unmethylated patients, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Chemoradiotherapy was less commonly used for elderly (≥\u200970 years, 58.5%) than non-elderly (<\u200970 years, 79.2%) patients. Among elderly patients, radiotherapy alone was more commonly administered than chemotherapy alone for patients with MGMT-unmethylated tumors (11.2% vs. 2.1%) and MGMT-methylated tumors (6.6% vs. 3.9%). However, chemotherapy alone was associated with a lower mortality risk (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.51-0.99, p\u2009=\u20090.04) than radiotherapy alone for elderly patients with MGMT-methylated tumors, while chemotherapy alone was associated with a higher mortality risk (HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.09-2.44, p\u2009=\u20090.02) than radiotherapy alone for elderly patients with MGMT-unmethylated tumors. Patients who were elderly, uninsured, insured through Medicaid, lived in zip codes with lower median education levels, or received care at non-academic programs were less likely to undergo MGMT testing. A high proportion of GBM patients in the United States undergo MGMT promoter testing, though significant sociodemographic disparities exist. While there was a decrease in chemoradiotherapy use with increasing age, radiotherapy alone was more commonly administered to elderly patients than chemotherapy alone irrespective of MGMT promoter methylation status.\n\nConsider:\n1.

It may be happened because of drug resistance against their typical receptors, since these receptor genes are often mutated by environmental stress. So identifying mutated oncodriver genes which could be used as potential drug target is essential in order to develop effective new therapeutic drugs as well as better prognosis for GBM patients. In this study, we analyzed whole exome sequencing (WES) profiles of NCBI database on GBM and matched-normal (control) samples originated from astrocyte like neural stem cells (NSC) of subventricular zone (SVZ) to explore GBM-causing mutated oncodriver genes, since SVZ is considered as the origin of GBM development. We detected 16 mutated oncodriver genes. Then, filtering by differential co-expression analysis based on independent RNA-Seq profiles of CGGA database revealed 10 genes as dysregulated oncodriver genes. Following that, 3 significantly overexpressed oncodriver genes (MTCH2, VWF, and WDR89) were identified as potential drug targets. Then molecular mechanisms of GBM development were investigated by these three overexpressed driver genes through gene ontology (GO), KEGG-pathways, Gene regulatory network (GRN) and mutation analysis. Finally, overexpressed oncodriver genes guided top-ranked six drug agents (Irinotecan, Imatinib, etoposide, pazopanib, trametinib and cabozanitinib) were recommended against GBM through molecular docking study. Most of our findings received support by the literature review also. Therefore, the findings of this study might carry potential values to the wet-lab researchers for further investigation in terms of diagnosis and therapies of GBM.\n\nConsider:\n1.

We analyzed the frequency of PD-L1 expression in glioma samples. Methodology In this two-year retrospective study, 45 glioma cases of varying grades (grades 2 to 4) were examined at a tertiary care hospital. Tumor samples that were formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) were obtained from the pathology archives of the hospital. According to the WHO Classification of Central Nervous System Tumors, 5th edition, tumor grading and histopathological subtyping were carried out. PD-L1 antibody (clone 28-8) and IDH1 (R132H, clone QM002, Quartett Immunodiagnostika, 1:100 dilution) markers were used for immunohistochemistry (IHC). The sections underwent deparaffinization, rehydration, and antigen retrieval using Leica bond III staining platform. Based on the tumor proportion score (TPS), which is the proportion of viable tumor cells with membranous staining, PD-L1 expression was assessed. The literature's standardized cut-off values were used to determine positive expression. Staining intensity and tumor cell location were used to determine the status of IDH1 mutations. Age, sex, and tumor location were among the clinical and demographic information gathered about the patient. The association between PD-L1 expression, glioma grades, and IDH1 (R132H) mutation status was assessed statistically using SPSS software and a Chi-square test. The threshold for statistical significance was p < 0.05. For every IHC run, positive and negative controls were used as part of the quality control procedures. To reduce bias and guarantee consistency, two pathologists and post graduate residents independently reviewed the results. Results PD-L1 expression was found in 27 out of 36 (75%) grade 4 glioblastoma multiforme cases and six out of nine (66.7%) grade 2 gliomas. Overall, 33/45 (73.3%) of the gliomas had PD-L1 expression. However, PD-L1 expression and glioma grade did not correlate in a statistically significant way. IDH1 (R132H) expression and PD-L1 were found to be inversely correlated (p < 0.05). Conclusion The findings suggest that PD-L1 may be a promising therapeutic target, even in the absence of significant grade-specific trends by\xa0demonstrating PD-L1 presence in the majority of glioma cases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in GBM immunotherapy. The results provide insight into the immune landscape of gliomas and pave the way for future research into effective combination therapies for GBM, despite the lack of a significant correlation between glioma grade and PD-L1 expression.\n\nConsider:\n1.

This study aims to develop a comprehensive prognostic model to identify biomarkers associated with temozolomide (TMZ) resistance. We employed a multifaceted approach, combining differential expression and univariate Cox regression analyses to screen for TMZ resistance-related differentially expressed genes (TMZR-RDEGs) in GBM. Using LASSO Cox analysis, we selected 12 TMZR-RDEGs to construct a risk score model, which was evaluated for performance through survival analysis, time-dependent ROC, and stratified analyses. Functional enrichment and mutation analyses were conducted to explore the underlying mechanisms of the risk score and its relationship with immune cell infiltration levels in GBM. The prognostic risk score model, based on the 12 TMZR-RDEGs, demonstrated high efficacy in predicting GBM patient outcomes and emerged as an independent predictive factor. Additionally, we focused on the molecule TSPAN13, whose role in GBM is not well understood. We assessed cell proliferation, migration, and invasion capabilities through in vitro assays (including CCK-8, Edu, wound healing, and transwell assays) and quantitatively analyzed TSPAN13 expression levels in clinical glioma samples using tissue microarray immunohistochemistry. The impact of TSPAN13 on TMZ resistance in GBM cells was validated through in vitro experiments and a mouse orthotopic xenograft model. Notably, TSPAN13 was upregulated in GBM and correlated with poorer patient prognosis. Knockdown of TSPAN13 inhibited GBM cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and enhanced sensitivity to TMZ treatment. This study provides a valuable prognostic tool for GBM and identifies TSPAN13 as a critical target for therapeutic intervention.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

Here, we characterized 5 murine GBM stem-like cell (mGSC) models derived from lentivirus-induced tumors in transgenic mice that are driven by the activation of the Nf1-Ras signaling pathway and inactivation of Tp53. MGSC lines (005, RIG, NF53, C1, and C3) were cultured as spheres in serum-free stem cell media. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was employed to quantify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Stem cell properties were characterized by stemness in vitro and tumorigenicity after intracerebral implantation in C57BL/6 mice. Tumor phenotypes and the immune microenvironment were characterized by immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and RNA sequencing. WES revealed a large variation in coding sequence SNPs across mGSC lines (~20-fold), likely influenced by the mixed backgrounds of the parental mice. MGSCs exhibited variable clonogenic sphere formation and CD133 expression levels. In vivo, they consistently initiated lethal malignant gliomas, with median survival ranging from 29 to 82 days, and showed strong CD44 expression and variable invasiveness. The tumor microenvironment featured an abundance of CD68+ macrophages and uniform high PD-L1+ myeloid cells, while T-cell infiltration varied among the models, with low mutation burden C1 and C3 exhibiting fewer tumor-infiltrating T cells. Upon orthotopic implantation in immunocompetent mice, mGSCs generate tumors characteristic of human GBM. Despite similar strategies to generate these mGSCs, they exhibited a range of phenotypes and immune profiles in mGSC-derived orthotopic tumors. These mGSCs provide new preclinical GBM models for developing GBM immunotherapies.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2. Study type and methodology\n3. Population characteristics\n4.

HNF1B is a critical transcription element in vertebrate proliferation and oncogenesis, which has been shown to play roles in reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism. Our previous results have identified HNF1B as a tumor suppressor that could inhibit the malignant progression of prostate cancer. Yet there is no pan-carcinomatosis analysis of HNF1B, which could help us better understand common and unique underlying mechanisms in mankind knubs to enhance novel and competent treatment. Here, in our research, we evaluated the utterance pattern and explored the function of HNF1B in 33 knub categories using the data from the Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and CLNICAL PROTEOMICTUMOR ANALYSIS CONSORTIUM (CPTAC) dataset. We found different HNF1B roles in various cancer types. HNF1B was upregulated in CHOL, STAD, KIRP, and THCA, and was downregulated in GBM, KICH, COAD, KIRC, LUSC, SARC, PAAD, and TGCT. Prognostic analyses indicated that higher HNF1B displayed better illness outcomes in BLCA, READ, and PRAD, while poorer outcomes in LUSC and THYM. HNF1B mutation was most frequent in endometrial cancer but was not associated with disease prognosis. It was discovered that HNF1B utterance relevant to endothelial cell penetration status in BLCA, ESCA, LUAD, LUSC, and TGCT, and carcinomatosis-associated fibroblast infiltration was observed in ESCA, KIRC, LIHC, and TGCT. Moreover, functional enrichment analysis disclosed that metabolism-related functions were implicated in the function of HNF1B. Taken together, our pan- carcinomatosis analysis showed the complicated roles of HNF1B in a variety of carcinomatoses, being able to improve the extensive comprehension of HNF1B's role in tumorigenesis.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Reduced expression of the MGMT gene (10q26.3), influenced primarily by the methylation of two differentially methylated regions (DMR1 and DMR2), is associated with a good response to temozolomide treatment. However, suitable methods for detecting the methylation of the MGMT gene promoter and setting appropriate cutoff values are debated. A cohort of 108 patients with histologically and genetically defined glioblastoma was retrospectively examined with methylation-specific Sanger sequencing (sSeq) and methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA) methods. The DMR2 region was methylated in 29% of samples, whereas DMR1 was methylated in 12% of samples. Methylation detected with the MS-MLPA method using probes MGMT_215, MGMT_190, and MGMT_124 from the ME012-A1 kit (located in DMR1 and DMR2) correlated with the methylation of the corresponding CpG dinucleotides detected with sSeq (p\u2009=\u20090.005 for probe MGMT_215; p\u2009<\u20090.001 for probe MGMT_190; p\u2009=\u20090.016 for probe MGMT_124). The threshold for methylation detection with the MS-MLPA method was calculated with a ROC curve analysis and principal components analysis of the data obtained with the MS-MLPA and sSeq methods, yielding a weighted value of 0.362. Thus, methylation of the MGMT gene promoter was confirmed in 36% of samples. These patients had statistically significantly better overall survival (p\u2009=\u20090.003). Our results show that the threshold for methylation detection with the MS-MLPA method determined here is useful from a diagnostic perspective because it allows the stratification of patients who will benefit from specific treatment protocols, including temozolomide. Detailed analysis of the MGMT gene promoter enables the more-precise and personalized treatment of patients with glioblastoma.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

The survival rate remains low despite standard therapies, highlighting the urgent need for novel treatment strategies. Advanced imaging techniques, particularly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are crucial in assessing GBM. Disruptions in various oncogenic signaling pathways, such as Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK)-Ras-Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling, Phosphoinositide 3- Kinases (PI3Ks), tumor protein p53 (TP53), and Neurogenic locus notch homolog protein (NOTCH), contribute to the development of different tumor types, each exhibiting distinct morphological and phenotypic features that can be observed at a microscopic level. However, identifying genetic abnormalities for targeted therapy often requires invasive procedures, prompting exploration into non-invasive approaches like radiogenomics. This study explores the utility of radiogenomics and machine learning (ML) in predicting these oncogenic signaling pathways in GBM patients. We collected post-operative MRI scans (T1w, T1c, FLAIR, T2w) from the BRATS-19 dataset, including scans from patients with both GBM and LGG, linked to genetic and clinical data via TCGA and CPTAC. Signaling pathway data was manually extracted from cBioPortal. Radiomic features were extracted from four MRI modalities using PyRadiomics. Dimensionality reduction and feature selection were applied and Data imbalance was addressed with SMOTE. Five ML models were trained to predict signaling pathways, with Grid Search optimizing hyperparameters and 5-fold cross-validation ensuring unbiased performance. Each model's performance was evaluated using various metrics on test data. Our results showed a positive association between most signaling pathways and the radiomic features derived from MRI scans. The best models achieved high AUC scores, namely 0.7 for RTK-RAS, 0.8 for PI3K, 0.75 for TP53, and 0.4 for NOTCH, and therefore, demonstrated the potential of ML models in accurately predicting oncogenic signaling pathways from radiomic features, thereby informing personalized therapeutic approaches and improving patient outcomes. We present a novel approach for the non-invasive prediction of deregulation in oncogenic signaling pathways in glioblastoma (GBM) by integrating radiogenomic data with machine learning models. This research contributes to advancing precision medicine in GBM management, highlighting the importance of integrating radiomics with genomic data to understand tumor behavior and treatment response better.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Initial treatment involved surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and temozolomide (TMZ). Subsequent recurrences were managed with re-resection and dabrafenib/trametinib combination therapy. Notably, a new, non-clonal BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> -negative tumor developed in a distant location, highlighting the challenge of clonal evolution and resistance in GBM management. The patient's disease ultimately progressed despite multiple lines of therapy, including targeted inhibition. Identifying mechanisms of resistance and tailoring flexible treatment approaches are essential for advancing outcomes in BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> -mutant GBM. This case emphasizes the value of molecular profiling in personalizing treatment for patients with multifocal disease. The evolving nature of these tumors requires persistent clinical monitoring and treatment adjustments based on tissue diagnostics.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors show promise in cancer therapy, yet their efficacy in glioblastomas, particularly with IDH1 mutations, remains unclear. This study analyzed two independent NGS datasets (n = 577 and n = 153) from TCGA to investigate the expression of PDCD1 and CD274 in glioblastomas and their relationship with IDH1 mutations. We used cBioPortal for mutation analysis, RNA seq for expression analysis, miRDB and miRabel for differential expression of miRNAs, and Kaplan-Meier for survival prediction. We found that 5.4% of glioblastomas harbored IDH1 mutations, correlating with improved overall survival (OS) (p = 2.196e-3). Different glioblastoma cohorts showed a diverse IDH1 mutational prevalence (4-31%). Despite this, IDH1<sup>Mu</sup> was consistently associated with better OS (p = 8.235e-5). Notably, PDCD1 and CD274 were statistically significantly highly expressed in both IDH1<sup>Wt</sup> (p < 0.0001) and IDH1<sup>Mu</sup> tumors (p < 0.0001), with higher expression linked to poorer survival outcomes (PDCD1: p = 0.009; CD274: p = 0.02). Differential co-expression analyses revealed distinct gene and miRNA profiles for IDH1<sup>Wt</sup> and IDH1<sup>Mu</sup> glioblastomas, with specific upregulation of PTEN and downregulation of MUC16 in IDH1<sup>Wt</sup>, and upregulation of PIK3R1 in IDH1<sup>Mu</sup>. Additionally, PIK3R1 and ITGB2 emerged as critical druggable targets. Our findings indicate that PDCD1 and CD274 are highly expressed irrespective of IDH1 mutation statuses, suggesting that glioblastomas could benefit from immunotherapy. Moreover, IDH1<sup>Mu</sup> glioblastomas may require a combination of PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors and immunotherapy due to PIK3R1 overexpression.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

We focused on multi-habitat deep image descriptors as our basic focus. A subset of the BRATS 2021 MGMT methylation dataset containing both MGMT class labels and segmentation masks was used. A comprehensive mask fusion approach was developed to select relevant image crops of diseased tissue. These fusion masks, which were guided by multiple sequences, helped collect information from the regions that seem disease-free to radiologists in standard MRI sequences while harboring pathology. Integrating the information in different MRI sequences and leveraging the high entropic capacity of deep neural networks, we built a 3D ROI-based custom CNN classifier for the automatic prediction of MGMT methylation status of glioblastoma in multi-parametric MRI. Single sequence-based classifiers reached intermediate predictive performance with 0.65, 0.71, 0.77, and 0.82 accuracy for T1W, T2W, T1 contrast-enhanced, and FLAIR sequences, respectively. The multiparametric classifier using T1 contrast-enhanced and FLAIR images reached 0.88 accuracy. The accuracy of the four-input model that used all sequences was 0.81. The best model reached 0.90 ROC AUC value. Integrating human knowledge in the form of relevant target selection was a useful approach in MGMT methylation status prediction in MRI. Exploration of means to integrate radiology knowledge into the models and achieve human-machine collaboration may help to develop better models. MGMT methylation status of glioblastoma is an important prognostic marker and is also important for treatment decisions. The preoperative non-invasive predictive ability and the explanation tools of the developed model may help clinicians to better understand imaging phenotypes of MGMT methylation status of glial tumors.\n\nConsider:\n1.

In the following 20 years, it has lived up to expectations. A substantial body of evidence has demonstrated that it is closely related to the development, metastasis, migration, and drug resistance of malignant tumors. In recent years, research on the MSI protein has advanced, and many novel viewpoints and drug resistance attempts have been derived; for example, tumor protein p53 mutations and MSI-binding proteins lead to resistance to protein arginine N-methyltransferase 5-targeted therapy in lymphoma patients. Moreover, the high expression of MSI2 in pancreatic cancer might suppress its development and progression. As a significant member of the MSI family, MSI2 is closely associated with multiple malignant tumors, including hematological disorders, common abdominal tumors, and other tumor types (e.g., glioblastoma, breast cancer). MSI2 is highly expressed in the majority of tumors and is related to a poor disease prognosis. However, its specific expression levels and regulatory mechanisms may differ based on the tumor type. This review summarizes the research progress related to MSI2 in recent years, including its occurrence, migration mechanism, and drug resistance, as well as the prospect of developing tumor immunosuppressants and biomarkers.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Key metabolic pathways, including glycolysis, lactate production, and lipid metabolism, are upregulated to sustain tumor survival in the hypoxic and nutrient-deprived tumor microenvironment (TME), while glutamine and tryptophan metabolism further contribute to the aggressive phenotype of GBM. These metabolic alterations impair immune cell function, leading to exhaustion and stress in CD8+ and CD4+ T cells while favoring immunosuppressive populations such as regulatory T cells (Tregs) and M2-like macrophages. Recent studies emphasize the role of slow-cycling GBM cells (SCCs), lipid-laden macrophages, and tumor-associated astrocytes (TAAs) in reshaping GBM's metabolic landscape and reinforcing immune evasion. Genetic mutations, including <i>Isocitrate Dehydrogenase</i> (<i>IDH</i>) mutations, <i>Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor</i> (<i>EGFR</i>) amplification, and <i>Phosphotase and Tensin Homolog</i> (<i>PTEN</i>) loss, further drive metabolic reprogramming and offer potential targets for therapy. Understanding the relationship between GBM metabolism and immune suppression is critical for overcoming therapeutic resistance. This review focuses on the role of metabolic rewiring in GBM, its impact on the immune microenvironment, and the potential of combining metabolic targeting with immunotherapy to improve clinical outcomes for GBM patients.\n\nConsider:\n1.

This variability demands combination treatments to improve therapeutic outcomes. A significant obstacle in treating GBM is the expression of O<sup>6</sup>-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase, a DNA repair enzyme that reduces the efficacy of the standard alkylating agent, temozolomide, in about 50% of patients. This underscores the need for novel, more targeted therapies. Our study investigates the metabolic-epigenetic impact of combining SN-38, a novel topoisomerase inhibitor inducing DNA double-strand breaks, with rabusertib, a checkpoint kinase 1 inhibitor. We identified this synergistic combination through high-throughput drug screening across a panel of GBM cell lines using a cancer drug library combined with SN-38. A secondary metabolic screening with the PEDS algorithm demonstrated a synergistic modulation of purine, one-carbon, and redox metabolism. Furthermore, the combined treatment led to the significant depletion of epigenetically relevant metabolites such as 5-methyl-cytosine, acetyl-lysine, and trimethyl-lysine. Reduced intermediates of the glutathione cycle indicated increased cellular stress following combinatorial treatment. Overall, the combination of SN-38 and rabusertib synergistically disrupts metabolites associated with epigenetic adaptations, leading to cytotoxicity independent of O<sup>6</sup>-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase status, thereby underpinning this combination as a promising candidate for combinatorial therapy in GBM.\n\nConsider:\n1.

This study identified detectable oncogene fusions in glioma patients through an integrated analysis of genomic and transcriptomic data, which encompassed whole exon sequencing and next-generation RNA sequencing. In addition, this study also conducted a comparison of the genetic characteristics, tumor microenvironment, mutation burden and survival between glioma patients with or without gene fusions. A total of 68 glioma patients were enrolled in this study, including glioblastoma (GBM), low grade glioma (LGG) and diffuse midline glioma (DMG). 14 cases of GBM patients (51.9%, 14/27) were found to harbor the following 70 oncogenic gene fusions: ROS1 (n\u2009=\u20098), NTRK (n\u2009=\u20095), KIF5 (n\u2009=\u20095), RET (n\u2009=\u20093) and other infrequent gene fusions (n\u2009=\u200949). A total of 11 gene fusions were identified in 8 LGG patients (32.0%, 8/25) and seven gene fusions were identified in one DMG patient (16.7%, 1/6). In GBM patient group, five genes including HOXA3, ACTB, CDK5, GNA12 and CARD11 exhibited a statistically significant higher copy number amplification frequency in the GBM group without gene fusions compared to that in the GBM group with gene fusions. In LGG patient group, CDK5 gene was also found to exhibit a statistically significant higher amplification frequency in the LGG group without gene fusions. In addition, KMT2D exhibited a statistically significant higher mutation frequency in the LGG group with gene fusions compared to that in the LGG group without gene fusions. Comparison of the other genetic characteristics including immune cell infiltration score, tumor mutation burden (TMB), and microsatellite instability (MSI). The results showed no statistically significant differences were observed between fusion and non-fusion group of GBM and LGG. The survival analysis revealed that GBM patients without gene fusions exhibited a longer median survival (737\xa0days) compared to GBM patients with gene fusions (642\xa0days), but without a statistical significancy. Our study has identified a set of gene fusions present in gliomas, including a number of novel gene fusions that have not been previously reported. We have also elucidated the underlying genetic characteristics of glioma with gene fusions. Collectively, our findings have the potential to inform future clinical treatment strategies for patients with glioma.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

Despite continuation of multimodal treatment, further extracerebral manifestations occurred 11\xa0months after the initial diagnosis, both in the cranial bone as well as metastases in the right parotid gland, cervical lymph nodes, and lungs. While local radiotherapy enabled the cerebral lesions to be controlled, the patient's clinical condition deteriorated rapidly despite simultaneous systemic therapy. The treatment had to be discontinued, and the patient died 5\xa0weeks after confirmation of the multilocal extracerebral manifestations and a\xa0total of 12\xa0months after initial diagnosis. Extracerebral manifestations of glioblastoma require close collaboration and joint decision-making with the patient, with an emphasis on palliative strategies.\n\nConsider:\n1.

However, whether all patients can benefit from supramaximal resection of nCE tumors and the optimal resection target remains unclear, especially for the glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype under the new WHO CNS tumor classification. Clinical and surgical characteristics were collected from 155 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype from the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas, and a prospective cohort of 128 patients was enrolled for external validation. Recursive partitioning analysis was used to identify risk groups considering the effects of residual nCE tumor volume (RnTV) and clinical factors on overall survival (OS). Age, preoperative Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS), MGMT promoter status, and postoperative RnTV were independently associated with patient survival. Four risk groups with distinct prognoses were identified: Group 1 (median OS: 13.4 months), RnTV >43.27\xa0ml; Group 2 (median OS: 17.8 months), RnTV ≤43.27\xa0ml, KPS ≤90, and age ≥60; Group 3 (median OS: 22.3 months), RnTV 5.27-43.27\xa0ml, age <60; Group 4 (median OS: 38.2 months) including 4a, KPS 100 and RnTV ≤43.27\xa0ml; and 4b, KPS ≤90, age <60, and RnTV ≤5.27\xa0ml. These results were retained regardless of MGMT promoter methylation status and validated in the external prospective validation cohort. Supramaximal nCE tumor resection enhances survival outcomes in glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype, but depending on clinical characteristics. In young symptomatic patients, supramaximal resection should be recommended with the RnTV ≤5.27\xa0ml; in symptomless patients or elder patients, keeping the RnTV ≤43.27 is recommended to obtain the survival benefit from tumor resection surgery.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Although the survival is generally dismal for glioblastoma patients, risk stratification and the identification of high-risk subgroups is important for prompt and aggressive management. The G1-G7 molecular subgroup classification based on the MAPK pathway activation has offered for the first time a non-redundant, all-inclusive classification of adult glioblastoma. Five patients from the large, 218-patient, prospective cohort showed germline mutations in mismatch repair (MMR) genes (Lynch syndrome) and a significantly worse median survival of 3.25 months post-surgery than those from the G1/EGFR and G3/NF1 major subgroups, or from the rest of the cohort adjusted for age. These rare tumors were assigned to a new subgroup, G3/MMR, a G3/NF1 subgroup spin-off, as they generally show genomic alterations leading to RAS activation, such as <i>NF1</i> and <i>PTPN11</i> mutations. An integrated clinical, histologic and molecular analysis of the G3/MMR tumors showed distinct characteristics as compared to other glioblastomas, including those with iatrogenic high tumor mutation burden (TMB), warranting a separate subgroup. Prior history of cancer, midline location or multifocality, presence of multinucleated giant cells (MGCs), positive p53 and MMR immunohistochemistry, and specific molecular characteristics, including high TMB, <i>MSH2</i>/<i>MSH6</i> alterations, biallelic <i>TP53</i> Arg mutations and co-occurring <i>PIK3CA</i> p.R88Q and <i>PTEN</i> alterations, alert to this high-risk G3/MMR subgroup. The MGCs and p53 immunohistochemistry analysis in G1-G7 subgroups showed that one in 7 tumors with these characteristics is a G3/MMR glioblastoma. The FDA-approved first-line therapy for many advanced solid tumors consists of nivolumab-ipilimumab immune checkpoint inhibitors. One G3/MMR patient received this regimen and survived much longer than the rest, setting a proof-of-principle example for the treatment of these very aggressive G3/MMR glioblastomas.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Gliomas comprise high-grade gliomas like glioblastoma multiforme (GBMs), many of which have mutation in the tumor suppressor p53 gene and low-grade gliomas (LGGs). LGGs can progress to GBMs due to various factors. The available treatment options for GBMs and LGGs include surgical resection, radiation and chemotherapy. The chemotherapeutic drug available in the clinic is temozolomide (TMZ). However, TMZ can cause damage to DNA if taken for prolonged period. This warrants the discovery of drugs that would potentially elicit less adverse side effects while maintaining anticancer activity. To this end, we evaluated the impact of cinnamaldehyde (CA), a single, purified component of the natural product cinnamon. The elucidation of the mechanism of action revealed the impact of CA on reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Moreover, its effect on the extrinsic programmed cell death pathway resulted in the increase of apoptotic cell populations, invoking multicaspase. Notably, the cell survival/death pivotal molecule Bcl-2 was impacted. These effects were observed in both the types of brain tumor cells studied: GBMs, represented by U251 cells (p53 mutated cell line) and LGGs represented by H4 cells. Results from the current study suggest potential for CA as a therapeutic option as it is expected to have fewer adverse side effects due to it being a component of a natural product and possibly deter the progression of LGGs to GBMs.\n\nConsider:\n1.

However, O6-MeG repair by O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) contributes to drug resistance. Characterizing genomic profiles of O6-MeG could elucidate how O6-MeG accumulation is influenced by repair, but there are no methods to map genomic locations of O6-MeG. Here, we developed an immunoprecipitation- and polymerase-stalling-based method, termed O6-MeG-seq, to locate O6-MeG across the whole genome at single-nucleotide resolution. We analyzed O6-MeG formation and repair across sequence contexts and functional genomic regions in relation to MGMT expression in a glioblastoma-derived cell line. O6-MeG signatures were highly similar to mutational signatures from patients previously treated with temozolomide. Furthermore, MGMT did not preferentially repair O6-MeG with respect to sequence context, chromatin state or gene expression level, however, may protect oncogenes from mutations. Finally, we found an MGMT-independent strand bias in O6-MeG accumulation in highly expressed genes. These data provide high resolution insight on how O6-MeG formation and repair are impacted by genome structure and nucleotide sequence. Further, O6-MeG-seq is expected to enable future studies of DNA modification signatures as diagnostic markers for addressing drug resistance and preventing secondary cancers.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Conventional methods for assessing MGMT promoter methylation, such as methylation-specific PCR, are invasive and require tissue sampling. <b>Methods</b>: A comprehensive literature search was performed in compliance with the updated PRISMA 2020 guidelines within electronic databases MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, and IEEE Xplore. Search terms, including "MGMT", "methylation", "glioma", "glioblastoma", "machine learning", "deep learning", and "radiomics", were adopted in various MeSH combinations. Original studies in the English, Italian, German, and French languages were considered for inclusion. <b>Results</b>: This review analyzed 34 studies conducted in the last six years, focusing on assessing MGMT methylation status using radiomics (RD), deep learning (DL), or combined approaches. These studies utilized radiological data from the public (e.g., BraTS, TCGA) and private institutional datasets. Sixteen studies focused exclusively on glioblastoma (GBM), while others included low- and high-grade gliomas. Twenty-seven studies reported diagnostic accuracy, with fourteen achieving values above 80%. The combined use of DL and RD generally resulted in higher accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, although some studies reported lower minimum accuracy compared to studies using a single model. <b>Conclusions:</b> The integration of RD and DL offers a powerful, non-invasive tool for precisely recognizing MGMT promoter methylation status in gliomas, paving the way for enhanced personalized medicine in neuro-oncology. The heterogeneity of study populations, data sources, and methodologies reflected the complexity of the pipeline and machine learning algorithms, which may require general standardization to be implemented in clinical practice.\n\nConsider:\n1.

High levels of EGFR expression and mutations have been found in many GB patients, making the EGFR an attractive target for therapeutic treatment. The EGFRvIII mutant is the most studied, it is not found in normal cells and is positively associated with tumor cell aggressiveness and poor patient prognosis, not to mention there is a possibility of it being a tumor stem cell marker. Some anti-EGFR DNA aptamers have already been selected, including the aptamer U2. The goal of this study was to construct a more stable derivative of the aptamer U2, while not ruining its functional potential toward cell cultures from GB patients. A multiloop motif in a putative secondary structure of the aptamer U2 was taken as a key feature to design a novel minimal aptamer, Gol1, using molecular dynamics simulations for predicted 3D models. It turned out that the aptamer Gol1 has a similar putative secondary structure, with G-C base pairs providing its stability. The anti-proliferative activities of the aptamer Gol1 were assessed using patient-derived GB continuous cell cultures, G01 and BU881, with different abundances of EGFR and EGFRvIII. The transcriptome data for the cell culture G01, after aptamer Gol1 treatment, revealed significant changes in gene expression; it induced the transcription of genes associated with neurogenesis and cell differentiation, and it decreased the transcription of genes mediating key nuclear processes. There were significant changes in the gene transcription of key pro-oncogenic signaling pathways mediated by the EGFR. Therefore, the aptamer Gol1 could potentially be an efficient molecule for translation into biomedicine, in order to develop targeted therapy for GB patients.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Resistance to chemotherapy, particularly temozolomide (TMZ), is a significant challenge. The DNA repair enzyme MGMT and glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) often mediate this resistance. Recent studies highlight the therapeutic potential of natural compounds, particularly delphinidins, found in deep purple berries. Delphinidins are known for their ability to inhibit NF-κB signaling, a critical pathway for GB progression, chemoresistance, and MGMT expression. Our research demonstrates that glycosylated delphinidins have potential adjuvant use in the treatment of GB, offering a promising natural strategy to combat TMZ resistance. Specifically, we observed that delphinidin 3,5 di-glucoside has potent anticancer effects when used alone. Meanwhile, delphinidin 3 glucoside acted in synergy with temozolomide to decrease cell viability, highlighting its potential as an adjuvant. It also exerted a faster and more sustained inhibition of NF-κB, highlighting its potential for long-lasting therapeutic effects. These findings open new avenues for targeted therapies against glioblastoma, particularly to overcome treatment resistance.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

Differentiated CSC progenies retained the expression of key stemness genes and survival pathways, while activating the BMP-Smad signaling pathway and upregulating extracellular matrix components.

We observed that activation of NF-κB was positively correlated with the levels of O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) protein, a direct DNA repair enzyme leading to TMZ resistance, regardless of MGMT promoter methylation status, further supporting the clinical potential for inhibition of NF-kB signaling in GBM treatment. Our integrative analysis of the impact of GBM cell developmental states, in the context of genomic and molecular diversity of patient-derived models, provides valuable insights for pre-clinical studies aimed at optimizing treatment strategies.\n\nProvide a focused summary that:\n1.

N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification plays a critical role in the development of brain tumor. WTAP and ZC3H13 have been identified across various species. Immune contexture, which includes the tumor microenvironment (TME), plays a significant role in cancer progression and treatment. This study aimed to explore the potential impact between WTAP and ZC3H13 on the immunological characteristics of GBM. We utilized data from TCGA-GBM, GEO and CGGA datasets to obtain platform and probe data. Patients with GBM were stratified into two clusters based on the expression of WTAP and ZC3H13 using consensus clustering approach. Immune infiltration within the tumor microenvironment was assessed using ESTIMATE, CIBERSORT and ssGSEA methodologies. Functional disparities were determined through gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Tumor mutation burden (TMB) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) were also analyzed. Co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to identify genes associated with WTAP/ZC3H13 and immunity. Validation was performed using GEO and CGGA datasets. Our analysis revealed that cluster1 exhibited higher WTAP expression but lower ZC3H13 expression compared to cluster2. Cluster1 showed higher levels of immune infiltration and TMB compared to cluster2. WGCNA identified 15 genes closely associated with WTAP/ZC3H13 expression and immune scores, notably CTLA4, CD27, ICOS, and LAG3. Our results suggested that WTAP and ZC3H13 influence on immune contexture of GBM, providing new insights into tumor immunity in GBM.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

Here, we assessed the prevalence of MGMT methylation status among GBM patients in the United States. Additionally, we evaluated treatment practices and survival outcomes of GBM patients according to MGMT promoter methylation status. The National Cancer Database was queried to identify all adult U.S. patients (≥\u200918 years) diagnosed with IDH-wildtype GBM between 2018 and 2020. Treatment regimen was grouped into no chemotherapy and no radiotherapy, chemotherapy alone (without radiotherapy), radiotherapy alone (without chemotherapy), and chemoradiotherapy (chemotherapy and radiotherapy). Survival data were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves, log-rank tests, and multivariable Cox proportional hazard modeling. A total of 20,734 patients were included, of whom 6,404 (30.9%) had MGMT-methylated GBM, 9,065 (43.7%) had MGMT-unmethylated tumors, and 5,265 (25.4%) had unknown methylation status. The median and three-year overall survival were 12.4 months and 15.5%, respectively, for the entire cohort (16.4 months and 23.9% for MGMT-methylated patients and 11.8 months and 9.8% for MGMT-unmethylated patients, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Chemoradiotherapy was less commonly used for elderly (≥\u200970 years, 58.5%) than non-elderly (<\u200970 years, 79.2%) patients. Among elderly patients, radiotherapy alone was more commonly administered than chemotherapy alone for patients with MGMT-unmethylated tumors (11.2% vs. 2.1%) and MGMT-methylated tumors (6.6% vs. 3.9%). However, chemotherapy alone was associated with a lower mortality risk (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.51-0.99, p\u2009=\u20090.04) than radiotherapy alone for elderly patients with MGMT-methylated tumors, while chemotherapy alone was associated with a higher mortality risk (HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.09-2.44, p\u2009=\u20090.02) than radiotherapy alone for elderly patients with MGMT-unmethylated tumors. Patients who were elderly, uninsured, insured through Medicaid, lived in zip codes with lower median education levels, or received care at non-academic programs were less likely to undergo MGMT testing. A high proportion of GBM patients in the United States undergo MGMT promoter testing, though significant sociodemographic disparities exist. While there was a decrease in chemoradiotherapy use with increasing age, radiotherapy alone was more commonly administered to elderly patients than chemotherapy alone irrespective of MGMT promoter methylation status.\n\nConsider:\n1.

It may be happened because of drug resistance against their typical receptors, since these receptor genes are often mutated by environmental stress. So identifying mutated oncodriver genes which could be used as potential drug target is essential in order to develop effective new therapeutic drugs as well as better prognosis for GBM patients. In this study, we analyzed whole exome sequencing (WES) profiles of NCBI database on GBM and matched-normal (control) samples originated from astrocyte like neural stem cells (NSC) of subventricular zone (SVZ) to explore GBM-causing mutated oncodriver genes, since SVZ is considered as the origin of GBM development. We detected 16 mutated oncodriver genes. Then, filtering by differential co-expression analysis based on independent RNA-Seq profiles of CGGA database revealed 10 genes as dysregulated oncodriver genes. Following that, 3 significantly overexpressed oncodriver genes (MTCH2, VWF, and WDR89) were identified as potential drug targets. Then molecular mechanisms of GBM development were investigated by these three overexpressed driver genes through gene ontology (GO), KEGG-pathways, Gene regulatory network (GRN) and mutation analysis. Finally, overexpressed oncodriver genes guided top-ranked six drug agents (Irinotecan, Imatinib, etoposide, pazopanib, trametinib and cabozanitinib) were recommended against GBM through molecular docking study. Most of our findings received support by the literature review also. Therefore, the findings of this study might carry potential values to the wet-lab researchers for further investigation in terms of diagnosis and therapies of GBM.\n\nConsider:\n1.

We analyzed the frequency of PD-L1 expression in glioma samples. Methodology In this two-year retrospective study, 45 glioma cases of varying grades (grades 2 to 4) were examined at a tertiary care hospital. Tumor samples that were formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) were obtained from the pathology archives of the hospital. According to the WHO Classification of Central Nervous System Tumors, 5th edition, tumor grading and histopathological subtyping were carried out. PD-L1 antibody (clone 28-8) and IDH1 (R132H, clone QM002, Quartett Immunodiagnostika, 1:100 dilution) markers were used for immunohistochemistry (IHC). The sections underwent deparaffinization, rehydration, and antigen retrieval using Leica bond III staining platform. Based on the tumor proportion score (TPS), which is the proportion of viable tumor cells with membranous staining, PD-L1 expression was assessed. The literature's standardized cut-off values were used to determine positive expression. Staining intensity and tumor cell location were used to determine the status of IDH1 mutations. Age, sex, and tumor location were among the clinical and demographic information gathered about the patient. The association between PD-L1 expression, glioma grades, and IDH1 (R132H) mutation status was assessed statistically using SPSS software and a Chi-square test. The threshold for statistical significance was p < 0.05. For every IHC run, positive and negative controls were used as part of the quality control procedures. To reduce bias and guarantee consistency, two pathologists and post graduate residents independently reviewed the results. Results PD-L1 expression was found in 27 out of 36 (75%) grade 4 glioblastoma multiforme cases and six out of nine (66.7%) grade 2 gliomas. Overall, 33/45 (73.3%) of the gliomas had PD-L1 expression. However, PD-L1 expression and glioma grade did not correlate in a statistically significant way. IDH1 (R132H) expression and PD-L1 were found to be inversely correlated (p < 0.05). Conclusion The findings suggest that PD-L1 may be a promising therapeutic target, even in the absence of significant grade-specific trends by\xa0demonstrating PD-L1 presence in the majority of glioma cases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in GBM immunotherapy. The results provide insight into the immune landscape of gliomas and pave the way for future research into effective combination therapies for GBM, despite the lack of a significant correlation between glioma grade and PD-L1 expression.\n\nConsider:\n1.

This study aims to develop a comprehensive prognostic model to identify biomarkers associated with temozolomide (TMZ) resistance. We employed a multifaceted approach, combining differential expression and univariate Cox regression analyses to screen for TMZ resistance-related differentially expressed genes (TMZR-RDEGs) in GBM. Using LASSO Cox analysis, we selected 12 TMZR-RDEGs to construct a risk score model, which was evaluated for performance through survival analysis, time-dependent ROC, and stratified analyses. Functional enrichment and mutation analyses were conducted to explore the underlying mechanisms of the risk score and its relationship with immune cell infiltration levels in GBM. The prognostic risk score model, based on the 12 TMZR-RDEGs, demonstrated high efficacy in predicting GBM patient outcomes and emerged as an independent predictive factor. Additionally, we focused on the molecule TSPAN13, whose role in GBM is not well understood. We assessed cell proliferation, migration, and invasion capabilities through in vitro assays (including CCK-8, Edu, wound healing, and transwell assays) and quantitatively analyzed TSPAN13 expression levels in clinical glioma samples using tissue microarray immunohistochemistry. The impact of TSPAN13 on TMZ resistance in GBM cells was validated through in vitro experiments and a mouse orthotopic xenograft model. Notably, TSPAN13 was upregulated in GBM and correlated with poorer patient prognosis. Knockdown of TSPAN13 inhibited GBM cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and enhanced sensitivity to TMZ treatment. This study provides a valuable prognostic tool for GBM and identifies TSPAN13 as a critical target for therapeutic intervention.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

Here, we characterized 5 murine GBM stem-like cell (mGSC) models derived from lentivirus-induced tumors in transgenic mice that are driven by the activation of the Nf1-Ras signaling pathway and inactivation of Tp53. MGSC lines (005, RIG, NF53, C1, and C3) were cultured as spheres in serum-free stem cell media. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was employed to quantify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Stem cell properties were characterized by stemness in vitro and tumorigenicity after intracerebral implantation in C57BL/6 mice. Tumor phenotypes and the immune microenvironment were characterized by immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and RNA sequencing. WES revealed a large variation in coding sequence SNPs across mGSC lines (~20-fold), likely influenced by the mixed backgrounds of the parental mice. MGSCs exhibited variable clonogenic sphere formation and CD133 expression levels. In vivo, they consistently initiated lethal malignant gliomas, with median survival ranging from 29 to 82 days, and showed strong CD44 expression and variable invasiveness. The tumor microenvironment featured an abundance of CD68+ macrophages and uniform high PD-L1+ myeloid cells, while T-cell infiltration varied among the models, with low mutation burden C1 and C3 exhibiting fewer tumor-infiltrating T cells. Upon orthotopic implantation in immunocompetent mice, mGSCs generate tumors characteristic of human GBM. Despite similar strategies to generate these mGSCs, they exhibited a range of phenotypes and immune profiles in mGSC-derived orthotopic tumors. These mGSCs provide new preclinical GBM models for developing GBM immunotherapies.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2. Study type and methodology\n3. Population characteristics\n4.

HNF1B is a critical transcription element in vertebrate proliferation and oncogenesis, which has been shown to play roles in reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism. Our previous results have identified HNF1B as a tumor suppressor that could inhibit the malignant progression of prostate cancer. Yet there is no pan-carcinomatosis analysis of HNF1B, which could help us better understand common and unique underlying mechanisms in mankind knubs to enhance novel and competent treatment. Here, in our research, we evaluated the utterance pattern and explored the function of HNF1B in 33 knub categories using the data from the Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and CLNICAL PROTEOMICTUMOR ANALYSIS CONSORTIUM (CPTAC) dataset. We found different HNF1B roles in various cancer types. HNF1B was upregulated in CHOL, STAD, KIRP, and THCA, and was downregulated in GBM, KICH, COAD, KIRC, LUSC, SARC, PAAD, and TGCT. Prognostic analyses indicated that higher HNF1B displayed better illness outcomes in BLCA, READ, and PRAD, while poorer outcomes in LUSC and THYM. HNF1B mutation was most frequent in endometrial cancer but was not associated with disease prognosis. It was discovered that HNF1B utterance relevant to endothelial cell penetration status in BLCA, ESCA, LUAD, LUSC, and TGCT, and carcinomatosis-associated fibroblast infiltration was observed in ESCA, KIRC, LIHC, and TGCT. Moreover, functional enrichment analysis disclosed that metabolism-related functions were implicated in the function of HNF1B. Taken together, our pan- carcinomatosis analysis showed the complicated roles of HNF1B in a variety of carcinomatoses, being able to improve the extensive comprehension of HNF1B's role in tumorigenesis.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Reduced expression of the MGMT gene (10q26.3), influenced primarily by the methylation of two differentially methylated regions (DMR1 and DMR2), is associated with a good response to temozolomide treatment. However, suitable methods for detecting the methylation of the MGMT gene promoter and setting appropriate cutoff values are debated. A cohort of 108 patients with histologically and genetically defined glioblastoma was retrospectively examined with methylation-specific Sanger sequencing (sSeq) and methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA) methods. The DMR2 region was methylated in 29% of samples, whereas DMR1 was methylated in 12% of samples. Methylation detected with the MS-MLPA method using probes MGMT_215, MGMT_190, and MGMT_124 from the ME012-A1 kit (located in DMR1 and DMR2) correlated with the methylation of the corresponding CpG dinucleotides detected with sSeq (p\u2009=\u20090.005 for probe MGMT_215; p\u2009<\u20090.001 for probe MGMT_190; p\u2009=\u20090.016 for probe MGMT_124). The threshold for methylation detection with the MS-MLPA method was calculated with a ROC curve analysis and principal components analysis of the data obtained with the MS-MLPA and sSeq methods, yielding a weighted value of 0.362. Thus, methylation of the MGMT gene promoter was confirmed in 36% of samples. These patients had statistically significantly better overall survival (p\u2009=\u20090.003). Our results show that the threshold for methylation detection with the MS-MLPA method determined here is useful from a diagnostic perspective because it allows the stratification of patients who will benefit from specific treatment protocols, including temozolomide. Detailed analysis of the MGMT gene promoter enables the more-precise and personalized treatment of patients with glioblastoma.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

The survival rate remains low despite standard therapies, highlighting the urgent need for novel treatment strategies. Advanced imaging techniques, particularly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are crucial in assessing GBM. Disruptions in various oncogenic signaling pathways, such as Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK)-Ras-Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling, Phosphoinositide 3- Kinases (PI3Ks), tumor protein p53 (TP53), and Neurogenic locus notch homolog protein (NOTCH), contribute to the development of different tumor types, each exhibiting distinct morphological and phenotypic features that can be observed at a microscopic level. However, identifying genetic abnormalities for targeted therapy often requires invasive procedures, prompting exploration into non-invasive approaches like radiogenomics. This study explores the utility of radiogenomics and machine learning (ML) in predicting these oncogenic signaling pathways in GBM patients. We collected post-operative MRI scans (T1w, T1c, FLAIR, T2w) from the BRATS-19 dataset, including scans from patients with both GBM and LGG, linked to genetic and clinical data via TCGA and CPTAC. Signaling pathway data was manually extracted from cBioPortal. Radiomic features were extracted from four MRI modalities using PyRadiomics. Dimensionality reduction and feature selection were applied and Data imbalance was addressed with SMOTE. Five ML models were trained to predict signaling pathways, with Grid Search optimizing hyperparameters and 5-fold cross-validation ensuring unbiased performance. Each model's performance was evaluated using various metrics on test data. Our results showed a positive association between most signaling pathways and the radiomic features derived from MRI scans. The best models achieved high AUC scores, namely 0.7 for RTK-RAS, 0.8 for PI3K, 0.75 for TP53, and 0.4 for NOTCH, and therefore, demonstrated the potential of ML models in accurately predicting oncogenic signaling pathways from radiomic features, thereby informing personalized therapeutic approaches and improving patient outcomes. We present a novel approach for the non-invasive prediction of deregulation in oncogenic signaling pathways in glioblastoma (GBM) by integrating radiogenomic data with machine learning models. This research contributes to advancing precision medicine in GBM management, highlighting the importance of integrating radiomics with genomic data to understand tumor behavior and treatment response better.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Non-canonical mutations such as BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>, found in 1-2% of GBMs, activate the MEK-ERK signaling pathway. This mutation can be targeted by small molecule inhibitors, offering therapeutic potential for GBM. In this case report, we describe the management of a 67-year-old male with BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> -mutant GBM, who experienced both local clonal and distant non-clonal BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> -mutant recurrences. Initial treatment involved surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and temozolomide (TMZ). Subsequent recurrences were managed with re-resection and dabrafenib/trametinib combination therapy. Notably, a new, non-clonal BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> -negative tumor developed in a distant location, highlighting the challenge of clonal evolution and resistance in GBM management. The patient's disease ultimately progressed despite multiple lines of therapy, including targeted inhibition. Identifying mechanisms of resistance and tailoring flexible treatment approaches are essential for advancing outcomes in BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> -mutant GBM. This case emphasizes the value of molecular profiling in personalizing treatment for patients with multifocal disease. The evolving nature of these tumors requires persistent clinical monitoring and treatment adjustments based on tissue diagnostics.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

We focused on multi-habitat deep image descriptors as our basic focus. A subset of the BRATS 2021 MGMT methylation dataset containing both MGMT class labels and segmentation masks was used. A comprehensive mask fusion approach was developed to select relevant image crops of diseased tissue. These fusion masks, which were guided by multiple sequences, helped collect information from the regions that seem disease-free to radiologists in standard MRI sequences while harboring pathology. Integrating the information in different MRI sequences and leveraging the high entropic capacity of deep neural networks, we built a 3D ROI-based custom CNN classifier for the automatic prediction of MGMT methylation status of glioblastoma in multi-parametric MRI. Single sequence-based classifiers reached intermediate predictive performance with 0.65, 0.71, 0.77, and 0.82 accuracy for T1W, T2W, T1 contrast-enhanced, and FLAIR sequences, respectively. The multiparametric classifier using T1 contrast-enhanced and FLAIR images reached 0.88 accuracy. The accuracy of the four-input model that used all sequences was 0.81. The best model reached 0.90 ROC AUC value. Integrating human knowledge in the form of relevant target selection was a useful approach in MGMT methylation status prediction in MRI. Exploration of means to integrate radiology knowledge into the models and achieve human-machine collaboration may help to develop better models.

In the following 20 years, it has lived up to expectations. A substantial body of evidence has demonstrated that it is closely related to the development, metastasis, migration, and drug resistance of malignant tumors. In recent years, research on the MSI protein has advanced, and many novel viewpoints and drug resistance attempts have been derived; for example, tumor protein p53 mutations and MSI-binding proteins lead to resistance to protein arginine N-methyltransferase 5-targeted therapy in lymphoma patients. Moreover, the high expression of MSI2 in pancreatic cancer might suppress its development and progression. As a significant member of the MSI family, MSI2 is closely associated with multiple malignant tumors, including hematological disorders, common abdominal tumors, and other tumor types (e.g., glioblastoma, breast cancer). MSI2 is highly expressed in the majority of tumors and is related to a poor disease prognosis. However, its specific expression levels and regulatory mechanisms may differ based on the tumor type. This review summarizes the research progress related to MSI2 in recent years, including its occurrence, migration mechanism, and drug resistance, as well as the prospect of developing tumor immunosuppressants and biomarkers.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Key metabolic pathways, including glycolysis, lactate production, and lipid metabolism, are upregulated to sustain tumor survival in the hypoxic and nutrient-deprived tumor microenvironment (TME), while glutamine and tryptophan metabolism further contribute to the aggressive phenotype of GBM. These metabolic alterations impair immune cell function, leading to exhaustion and stress in CD8+ and CD4+ T cells while favoring immunosuppressive populations such as regulatory T cells (Tregs) and M2-like macrophages. Recent studies emphasize the role of slow-cycling GBM cells (SCCs), lipid-laden macrophages, and tumor-associated astrocytes (TAAs) in reshaping GBM's metabolic landscape and reinforcing immune evasion. Genetic mutations, including <i>Isocitrate Dehydrogenase</i> (<i>IDH</i>) mutations, <i>Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor</i> (<i>EGFR</i>) amplification, and <i>Phosphotase and Tensin Homolog</i> (<i>PTEN</i>) loss, further drive metabolic reprogramming and offer potential targets for therapy. Understanding the relationship between GBM metabolism and immune suppression is critical for overcoming therapeutic resistance. This review focuses on the role of metabolic rewiring in GBM, its impact on the immune microenvironment, and the potential of combining metabolic targeting with immunotherapy to improve clinical outcomes for GBM patients.\n\nConsider:\n1.

This study identified detectable oncogene fusions in glioma patients through an integrated analysis of genomic and transcriptomic data, which encompassed whole exon sequencing and next-generation RNA sequencing. In addition, this study also conducted a comparison of the genetic characteristics, tumor microenvironment, mutation burden and survival between glioma patients with or without gene fusions. A total of 68 glioma patients were enrolled in this study, including glioblastoma (GBM), low grade glioma (LGG) and diffuse midline glioma (DMG). 14 cases of GBM patients (51.9%, 14/27) were found to harbor the following 70 oncogenic gene fusions: ROS1 (n\u2009=\u20098), NTRK (n\u2009=\u20095), KIF5 (n\u2009=\u20095), RET (n\u2009=\u20093) and other infrequent gene fusions (n\u2009=\u200949). A total of 11 gene fusions were identified in 8 LGG patients (32.0%, 8/25) and seven gene fusions were identified in one DMG patient (16.7%, 1/6). In GBM patient group, five genes including HOXA3, ACTB, CDK5, GNA12 and CARD11 exhibited a statistically significant higher copy number amplification frequency in the GBM group without gene fusions compared to that in the GBM group with gene fusions. In LGG patient group, CDK5 gene was also found to exhibit a statistically significant higher amplification frequency in the LGG group without gene fusions. In addition, KMT2D exhibited a statistically significant higher mutation frequency in the LGG group with gene fusions compared to that in the LGG group without gene fusions. Comparison of the other genetic characteristics including immune cell infiltration score, tumor mutation burden (TMB), and microsatellite instability (MSI). The results showed no statistically significant differences were observed between fusion and non-fusion group of GBM and LGG. The survival analysis revealed that GBM patients without gene fusions exhibited a longer median survival (737\xa0days) compared to GBM patients with gene fusions (642\xa0days), but without a statistical significancy. Our study has identified a set of gene fusions present in gliomas, including a number of novel gene fusions that have not been previously reported. We have also elucidated the underlying genetic characteristics of glioma with gene fusions. Collectively, our findings have the potential to inform future clinical treatment strategies for patients with glioma.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

Despite continuation of multimodal treatment, further extracerebral manifestations occurred 11\xa0months after the initial diagnosis, both in the cranial bone as well as metastases in the right parotid gland, cervical lymph nodes, and lungs. While local radiotherapy enabled the cerebral lesions to be controlled, the patient's clinical condition deteriorated rapidly despite simultaneous systemic therapy. The treatment had to be discontinued, and the patient died 5\xa0weeks after confirmation of the multilocal extracerebral manifestations and a\xa0total of 12\xa0months after initial diagnosis.

However, whether all patients can benefit from supramaximal resection of nCE tumors and the optimal resection target remains unclear, especially for the glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype under the new WHO CNS tumor classification. Clinical and surgical characteristics were collected from 155 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype from the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas, and a prospective cohort of 128 patients was enrolled for external validation. Recursive partitioning analysis was used to identify risk groups considering the effects of residual nCE tumor volume (RnTV) and clinical factors on overall survival (OS). Age, preoperative Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS), MGMT promoter status, and postoperative RnTV were independently associated with patient survival. Four risk groups with distinct prognoses were identified: Group 1 (median OS: 13.4 months), RnTV >43.27\xa0ml; Group 2 (median OS: 17.8 months), RnTV ≤43.27\xa0ml, KPS ≤90, and age ≥60; Group 3 (median OS: 22.3 months), RnTV 5.27-43.27\xa0ml, age <60; Group 4 (median OS: 38.2 months) including 4a, KPS 100 and RnTV ≤43.27\xa0ml; and 4b, KPS ≤90, age <60, and RnTV ≤5.27\xa0ml. These results were retained regardless of MGMT promoter methylation status and validated in the external prospective validation cohort. Supramaximal nCE tumor resection enhances survival outcomes in glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype, but depending on clinical characteristics. In young symptomatic patients, supramaximal resection should be recommended with the RnTV ≤5.27\xa0ml; in symptomless patients or elder patients, keeping the RnTV ≤43.27 is recommended to obtain the survival benefit from tumor resection surgery.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Although the survival is generally dismal for glioblastoma patients, risk stratification and the identification of high-risk subgroups is important for prompt and aggressive management. The G1-G7 molecular subgroup classification based on the MAPK pathway activation has offered for the first time a non-redundant, all-inclusive classification of adult glioblastoma. Five patients from the large, 218-patient, prospective cohort showed germline mutations in mismatch repair (MMR) genes (Lynch syndrome) and a significantly worse median survival of 3.25 months post-surgery than those from the G1/EGFR and G3/NF1 major subgroups, or from the rest of the cohort adjusted for age. These rare tumors were assigned to a new subgroup, G3/MMR, a G3/NF1 subgroup spin-off, as they generally show genomic alterations leading to RAS activation, such as <i>NF1</i> and <i>PTPN11</i> mutations. An integrated clinical, histologic and molecular analysis of the G3/MMR tumors showed distinct characteristics as compared to other glioblastomas, including those with iatrogenic high tumor mutation burden (TMB), warranting a separate subgroup. Prior history of cancer, midline location or multifocality, presence of multinucleated giant cells (MGCs), positive p53 and MMR immunohistochemistry, and specific molecular characteristics, including high TMB, <i>MSH2</i>/<i>MSH6</i> alterations, biallelic <i>TP53</i> Arg mutations and co-occurring <i>PIK3CA</i> p.R88Q and <i>PTEN</i> alterations, alert to this high-risk G3/MMR subgroup. The MGCs and p53 immunohistochemistry analysis in G1-G7 subgroups showed that one in 7 tumors with these characteristics is a G3/MMR glioblastoma. The FDA-approved first-line therapy for many advanced solid tumors consists of nivolumab-ipilimumab immune checkpoint inhibitors. One G3/MMR patient received this regimen and survived much longer than the rest, setting a proof-of-principle example for the treatment of these very aggressive G3/MMR glioblastomas.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Gliomas comprise high-grade gliomas like glioblastoma multiforme (GBMs), many of which have mutation in the tumor suppressor p53 gene and low-grade gliomas (LGGs). LGGs can progress to GBMs due to various factors. The available treatment options for GBMs and LGGs include surgical resection, radiation and chemotherapy. The chemotherapeutic drug available in the clinic is temozolomide (TMZ). However, TMZ can cause damage to DNA if taken for prolonged period. This warrants the discovery of drugs that would potentially elicit less adverse side effects while maintaining anticancer activity. To this end, we evaluated the impact of cinnamaldehyde (CA), a single, purified component of the natural product cinnamon. The elucidation of the mechanism of action revealed the impact of CA on reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Moreover, its effect on the extrinsic programmed cell death pathway resulted in the increase of apoptotic cell populations, invoking multicaspase. Notably, the cell survival/death pivotal molecule Bcl-2 was impacted. These effects were observed in both the types of brain tumor cells studied: GBMs, represented by U251 cells (p53 mutated cell line) and LGGs represented by H4 cells. Results from the current study suggest potential for CA as a therapeutic option as it is expected to have fewer adverse side effects due to it being a component of a natural product and possibly deter the progression of LGGs to GBMs.\n\nConsider:\n1.

However, O6-MeG repair by O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) contributes to drug resistance. Characterizing genomic profiles of O6-MeG could elucidate how O6-MeG accumulation is influenced by repair, but there are no methods to map genomic locations of O6-MeG. Here, we developed an immunoprecipitation- and polymerase-stalling-based method, termed O6-MeG-seq, to locate O6-MeG across the whole genome at single-nucleotide resolution. We analyzed O6-MeG formation and repair across sequence contexts and functional genomic regions in relation to MGMT expression in a glioblastoma-derived cell line. O6-MeG signatures were highly similar to mutational signatures from patients previously treated with temozolomide. Furthermore, MGMT did not preferentially repair O6-MeG with respect to sequence context, chromatin state or gene expression level, however, may protect oncogenes from mutations. Finally, we found an MGMT-independent strand bias in O6-MeG accumulation in highly expressed genes. These data provide high resolution insight on how O6-MeG formation and repair are impacted by genome structure and nucleotide sequence. Further, O6-MeG-seq is expected to enable future studies of DNA modification signatures as diagnostic markers for addressing drug resistance and preventing secondary cancers.\n\nConsider:\n1.

The methodology involved molecular docking, molecular dynamics, and immunofluorescence staining to confirm EGFRvIII binding. Additionally, vNAR R426 was conjugated to cisplatin and tested in the U87-MG glioma cell line. Results showed that the cisplatin-bound vNAR significantly outperformed free cisplatin at 72 hours, demonstrating enhanced drug delivery via receptor-mediated endocytosis and COPI-mediated nuclear translocation. These findings suggest that vNAR R426 could improve targeted cisplatin therapy in EGFRvIII-positive GBM, potentially enhancing cytotoxic efficacy and patient prognosis. While this study is preclinical, it supports further development of EGFRvIII-targeted therapies for GBM.\n\nArticle PMID:39919036\n### Focused Summary  \n\n#### **Main Findings and Conclusions:**  \nThis study highlights the impact of GBM mutations and differentiation states on treatment responses. **TP53 status** significantly influences transcriptional responses to radiation (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ), with wildtype (wt) p53 GBM cells showing a more dynamic response based on differentiation state and treatment modality. **MGMT protein levels**, rather than promoter methylation status, correlate with **NF-κB activation**, suggesting that NF-κB inhibition could enhance TMZ efficacy. Additionally, **astrocytic differentiation increases TMZ resistance** across models but does not affect RT sensitivity. A **DNA-damage-associated interferon (IFN) response** is activated in both mutant and wt p53 models, indicating a potential therapeutic target.  \n\n#### **Methodology Overview:**  \nResearchers used a **multi-omics approach** (proteomics, transcriptomics, genomics, and DNA methylation profiling) to analyze **patient-derived glioblastoma cancer stem cells (CSCs)** and their differentiated progeny. They assessed responses to **astrocytic differentiation, RT, and TMZ** to determine molecular pathways influencing treatment resistance.  \n\n#### **Population Characteristics:**  \nThe study utilized a **representative panel of GBM patient-derived CSCs**, covering diverse genomic backgrounds, including variations in **TP53, MGMT, and other key GBM mutations**.  \n\n#### **Key Statistical Results:**  \n- **TP53 status** modulates transcriptional response to RT and TMZ.  \n- **NF-κB activation correlates with MGMT protein levels** (not just promoter methylation), suggesting a role in TMZ resistance.  \n- **BMP-Smad signaling and extracellular matrix upregulation** in differentiated CSCs contribute to **increased TMZ resistance** but do not alter RT sensitivity.  \n- **DNA-damage-associated IFN response** is activated across both mutant and wt p53 models.  \n\n#### **Clinical Implications:**  \n- **TP53 mutations may guide personalized treatment approaches**, as wildtype and mutant p53 tumors respond differently to RT and TMZ.  \n- **NF-κB inhibition could enhance TMZ efficacy**, especially in tumors with high MGMT protein expression.  \n- **IFN pathway activation suggests a potential immunotherapy target** in GBM.  \n- **Differentiation state influences treatment resistance**, emphasizing the need for therapies targeting both CSCs and differentiated tumor cells.  \n\nThese findings provide a\n\nArticle PMID:39864140\nThis study investigated the relationship between **IDH1 mutations** and **immune checkpoint expression (PDCD1 and CD274)** in **glioblastoma (GBM)**, analyzing two independent **TCGA NGS datasets (n = 577 and n = 153)**. Researchers used **cBioPortal for mutation analysis, RNA sequencing for expression data, miRNA databases (miRDB, miRabel) for differential expression, and Kaplan-Meier for survival prediction**.\n\n### **Key Findings:**\n1. **IDH1 mutations were present in 5.4% of GBM cases** (ranging from 4-31% across cohorts) and were consistently associated with **improved overall survival (OS) (p = 8.235e-5)**.\n2. **PDCD1 and CD274 were highly expressed in both IDH1-mutant (IDH1<sup>Mu</sup>) and wild-type (IDH1<sup>Wt</sup>) tumors (p < 0.0001)**, with **higher expression correlating with worse survival (PDCD1: p = 0.009; CD274: p = 0.02)**.\n3. Differential gene expression analyses revealed:\n   - **IDH1<sup>Wt</sup> tumors**: **Upregulation of PTEN**, **downregulation of MUC16**.\n   - **IDH1<sup>Mu</sup> tumors**: **Upregulation of PIK3R1**, suggesting activation of the **PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway**.\n4. **PIK3R1 and ITGB2 were identified as potential druggable targets**.\n\n### **Clinical Implications:**\n- **Immunotherapy (e.g., PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors) may be beneficial in GBM, regardless of IDH1 mutation status**, given the high expression of PDCD1 and CD274.\n- **IDH1<sup>Mu</sup> GBMs may require a combination of immunotherapy and PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors** due to PIK3R1 overexpression.\n\nThese findings suggest that **targeted therapies should be tailored to IDH1 mutation status**, with **PI3K pathway inhibition potentially enhancing immunotherapy efficacy in IDH1-mutant GBMs**.\n\nProvide a comprehensive synthesis that:\n1.

High levels of EGFR expression and mutations have been found in many GB patients, making the EGFR an attractive target for therapeutic treatment. The EGFRvIII mutant is the most studied, it is not found in normal cells and is positively associated with tumor cell aggressiveness and poor patient prognosis, not to mention there is a possibility of it being a tumor stem cell marker. Some anti-EGFR DNA aptamers have already been selected, including the aptamer U2. The goal of this study was to construct a more stable derivative of the aptamer U2, while not ruining its functional potential toward cell cultures from GB patients. A multiloop motif in a putative secondary structure of the aptamer U2 was taken as a key feature to design a novel minimal aptamer, Gol1, using molecular dynamics simulations for predicted 3D models. It turned out that the aptamer Gol1 has a similar putative secondary structure, with G-C base pairs providing its stability. The anti-proliferative activities of the aptamer Gol1 were assessed using patient-derived GB continuous cell cultures, G01 and BU881, with different abundances of EGFR and EGFRvIII. The transcriptome data for the cell culture G01, after aptamer Gol1 treatment, revealed significant changes in gene expression; it induced the transcription of genes associated with neurogenesis and cell differentiation, and it decreased the transcription of genes mediating key nuclear processes. There were significant changes in the gene transcription of key pro-oncogenic signaling pathways mediated by the EGFR. Therefore, the aptamer Gol1 could potentially be an efficient molecule for translation into biomedicine, in order to develop targeted therapy for GB patients.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Non-canonical mutations such as BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>, found in 1-2% of GBMs, activate the MEK-ERK signaling pathway. This mutation can be targeted by small molecule inhibitors, offering therapeutic potential for GBM. In this case report, we describe the management of a 67-year-old male with BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> -mutant GBM, who experienced both local clonal and distant non-clonal BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> -mutant recurrences. Initial treatment involved surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and temozolomide (TMZ). Subsequent recurrences were managed with re-resection and dabrafenib/trametinib combination therapy. Notably, a new, non-clonal BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> -negative tumor developed in a distant location, highlighting the challenge of clonal evolution and resistance in GBM management. The patient's disease ultimately progressed despite multiple lines of therapy, including targeted inhibition. Identifying mechanisms of resistance and tailoring flexible treatment approaches are essential for advancing outcomes in BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> -mutant GBM. This case emphasizes the value of molecular profiling in personalizing treatment for patients with multifocal disease. The evolving nature of these tumors requires persistent clinical monitoring and treatment adjustments based on tissue diagnostics.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors show promise in cancer therapy, yet their efficacy in glioblastomas, particularly with IDH1 mutations, remains unclear. This study analyzed two independent NGS datasets (n = 577 and n = 153) from TCGA to investigate the expression of PDCD1 and CD274 in glioblastomas and their relationship with IDH1 mutations. We used cBioPortal for mutation analysis, RNA seq for expression analysis, miRDB and miRabel for differential expression of miRNAs, and Kaplan-Meier for survival prediction. We found that 5.4% of glioblastomas harbored IDH1 mutations, correlating with improved overall survival (OS) (p = 2.196e-3). Different glioblastoma cohorts showed a diverse IDH1 mutational prevalence (4-31%). Despite this, IDH1<sup>Mu</sup> was consistently associated with better OS (p = 8.235e-5). Notably, PDCD1 and CD274 were statistically significantly highly expressed in both IDH1<sup>Wt</sup> (p < 0.0001) and IDH1<sup>Mu</sup> tumors (p < 0.0001), with higher expression linked to poorer survival outcomes (PDCD1: p = 0.009; CD274: p = 0.02). Differential co-expression analyses revealed distinct gene and miRNA profiles for IDH1<sup>Wt</sup> and IDH1<sup>Mu</sup> glioblastomas, with specific upregulation of PTEN and downregulation of MUC16 in IDH1<sup>Wt</sup>, and upregulation of PIK3R1 in IDH1<sup>Mu</sup>. Additionally, PIK3R1 and ITGB2 emerged as critical druggable targets. Our findings indicate that PDCD1 and CD274 are highly expressed irrespective of IDH1 mutation statuses, suggesting that glioblastomas could benefit from immunotherapy. Moreover, IDH1<sup>Mu</sup> glioblastomas may require a combination of PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors and immunotherapy due to PIK3R1 overexpression.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

In recent years, research on the MSI protein has advanced, and many novel viewpoints and drug resistance attempts have been derived; for example, tumor protein p53 mutations and MSI-binding proteins lead to resistance to protein arginine N-methyltransferase 5-targeted therapy in lymphoma patients. Moreover, the high expression of MSI2 in pancreatic cancer might suppress its development and progression. As a significant member of the MSI family, MSI2 is closely associated with multiple malignant tumors, including hematological disorders, common abdominal tumors, and other tumor types (e.g., glioblastoma, breast cancer). MSI2 is highly expressed in the majority of tumors and is related to a poor disease prognosis. However, its specific expression levels and regulatory mechanisms may differ based on the tumor type. This review summarizes the research progress related to MSI2 in recent years, including its occurrence, migration mechanism, and drug resistance, as well as the prospect of developing tumor immunosuppressants and biomarkers.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Although the survival is generally dismal for glioblastoma patients, risk stratification and the identification of high-risk subgroups is important for prompt and aggressive management. The G1-G7 molecular subgroup classification based on the MAPK pathway activation has offered for the first time a non-redundant, all-inclusive classification of adult glioblastoma. Five patients from the large, 218-patient, prospective cohort showed germline mutations in mismatch repair (MMR) genes (Lynch syndrome) and a significantly worse median survival of 3.25 months post-surgery than those from the G1/EGFR and G3/NF1 major subgroups, or from the rest of the cohort adjusted for age. These rare tumors were assigned to a new subgroup, G3/MMR, a G3/NF1 subgroup spin-off, as they generally show genomic alterations leading to RAS activation, such as <i>NF1</i> and <i>PTPN11</i> mutations. An integrated clinical, histologic and molecular analysis of the G3/MMR tumors showed distinct characteristics as compared to other glioblastomas, including those with iatrogenic high tumor mutation burden (TMB), warranting a separate subgroup. Prior history of cancer, midline location or multifocality, presence of multinucleated giant cells (MGCs), positive p53 and MMR immunohistochemistry, and specific molecular characteristics, including high TMB, <i>MSH2</i>/<i>MSH6</i> alterations, biallelic <i>TP53</i> Arg mutations and co-occurring <i>PIK3CA</i> p.R88Q and <i>PTEN</i> alterations, alert to this high-risk G3/MMR subgroup. The MGCs and p53 immunohistochemistry analysis in G1-G7 subgroups showed that one in 7 tumors with these characteristics is a G3/MMR glioblastoma. The FDA-approved first-line therapy for many advanced solid tumors consists of nivolumab-ipilimumab immune checkpoint inhibitors. One G3/MMR patient received this regimen and survived much longer than the rest, setting a proof-of-principle example for the treatment of these very aggressive G3/MMR glioblastomas.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Aberrant expression of RNF7 has been observed in various tumor types and is known to significantly influence tumor initiation and progression. However, the specific role of RNF7 in glioblastoma remains unclear. IDH (isocitrate dehydrogenase) mutations, which induce metabolic reprogramming and result in notable heterogeneity among glioma with different IDH genotypes. Through analysis of public glioma databases, we identified a high expression of RNF7 in glioma and its correlation with patient prognosis. Moreover, we observed variations in RNF7 expression and its association with patient outcomes under different treatment modalities among different IDH genotypes. In this study, we demonstrated the critical role of RNF7 in the malignant phenotype of IDH1-mutant glioma and its contribution to radiation resistance. Subsequent functional enrichment analysis of RNF7 in glioma, coupled with validation through cellular experiments, confirmed its significant involvement in maintaining redox balance. Our findings suggest that RNF7 exerts a buffering effect against radiation-induced oxidative stress and counterbalances the redox stress induced by IDH1 mutation through its anti-ROS activity. Additionally, our follow-up investigations revealed that the upregulation of RNF7 after radiation exposure and in IDH1-mutant glioma cells is induced by ROS. Collectively, our study underscores the potential of RNF7 as a molecular biomarker in glioma. Elevated RNF7 expression often indicates a heightened metabolic resilience in glioma, leading to resistance against radiotherapy.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

The heterogeneity of GBM complicates diagnosis and treatment, driving research into molecular biomarkers that can offer insights into tumor behavior and guide personalized therapies. This review explores recent advances in molecular biomarkers, highlighting their potential to improve diagnosis and treatment outcomes in GBM patients. Key biomarkers such as MGMT promoter methylation, IDH1/2 mutations, EGFR amplification, and TERT promoter mutations, etc., are examined for their roles in prognosis, therapeutic response, and tumor classification. While molecular biomarkers offer valuable insights for tailoring GBM treatments, their clinical application is hindered by tumor heterogeneity, dynamic genetic evolution, and the lack of standardized testing methods. Future research should aim to confirm new biomarkers and incorporate them into regular clinical practice to improve prognosis and treatment choices. Advances in genomic and proteomic technologies, along with consistent biomarker detection, could transform GBM care and enhance patient outcomes.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

To explore the relationship between MRI perfusion metrics (rCBV, rCBF), genetic markers, and contrast enhancement patterns in gliomas, aiming to enhance diagnostic accuracy and inform personalized therapeutic strategies. Additionally, other radiological features, such as the T2/FLAIR mismatch sign, are evaluated for their predictive utility in IDH mutations. Retrospective cohort study. 67 patients with brain tumors (including glioblastoma, astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma) undergoing surgical resection. 1.5 Tesla MRI, including T1 pre- and post-contrast, FLAIR, DWI, and DSC sequences. Semiquantitative perfusion metrics (rCBV, rCBF) were evaluated against genetic markers (IDH1, EGFR, CDKN2A, PDGFRA, MGMT, TERT, 1p19q, PTEN, TP53, H3F3A) through advanced MRI techniques. Contrast enhancement was assessed, and genetic alterations were confirmed via histopathological and molecular analyses. Chi-square test, sensitivity, specificity, and ROC analysis for predictive modeling; significance level set at p\xa0<\xa00.05. Statistically significant differences in perfusion metrics were observed among tumors with distinct genetic profiles, with primary tumors and those harboring specific mutations (IDH1 wildtype, EGFR amplification, CDKN2A homozygous deletion, PDGFRA amplification) showing higher perfusion values. A cut-off value of <4 for rCBV in predicting IDH1 mutation yielded a sensitivity of 61.5\xa0% and specificity of 82.1\xa0%. For CDKN2A deletion, a cut-off of >5 resulted in a sensitivity of 75\xa0% and specificity of 74.6\xa0%, with an ROC value of 0.78. Integrating perfusion MRI with genetic analysis offers a promising approach to improving the diagnostic and therapeutic landscape for brain tumors, indicating a substantial step toward personalized neuro-oncology. Additionally, findings like the T2/FLAIR mismatch sign highlight the potential for preoperative molecular predictions when biopsy is not feasible. These findings support further validation in larger, multi-institutional studies to solidify their role in clinical practice.

Personalized treatment based on molecular markers may help improve the prognosis. We aimed to evaluate whether apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) histogram analysis can better predict MGMT and TERT molecular characteristics and to determine the prognostic relevance of genetic profile in patients with GBM. MRI, clinical, and pathological data of 79 patients with GBM were retrospectively collected. The ADC values based on histogram analysis were described using 10th percentile (p10), 90th percentile (p90), mean, median, minimum, maximum, skewness, kurtosis, and entropy. The independent-sample t test, linear correlation analysis, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and Cox proportional hazard regression were performed. MGMT promoter methylation and TERT promoter mutation were detected in 53.2% and 44.3% of GBM patients, respectively. The ADC<sub>p10</sub> in MGMT promoter unmethylated group was significantly lower than that in the MGMT promoter methylated group (p\xa0=\xa00.005). There were significant differences in ADC<sub>min</sub>, ADC<sub>p10</sub>, ADC<sub>mean</sub>, and entropy between TERT promoter mutant and wild-type groups. Entropy showed the best diagnostic performance in differentiating between positive and negative TERT groups (AUC\xa0=\xa00.722, p\xa0=\xa00.001). Overall survival (OS) showed a positive correlation with ADC<sub>min</sub>. The TERT promoter mutation was the only independent prognostic factor for GBM. ADC histogram analysis may be a potential noninvasive biomarker for differentiating MGMT and TERT molecular markers and providing prognostic information for GBM patients.\n\nConsider:\n1.

The molecular profile of adult PLG has not been well-characterized. We report the clinical, pathological, and molecular findings of six adult PLG patients (five males and one female), median age 58\u2009years. All cases exhibited pathological leptomeningeal enhancement at presentation. Leptomeningeal biopsy was diagnostic in five (of six) cases, revealing infiltration by an astrocytic glioma with mitotic activity, lacking microvascular proliferation or necrosis. One case was diagnosed at autopsy. All tumors were IDH-wildtype, with five harboring TERT promoter mutations. Additional mutations identified were PTEN in one case, TP53 in two cases, and NF1 in two cases. A chromosome profile with +7/-10 was found in four cases, whereas the remaining two showed either chromosome 7 or 7p gain only. Four cases showed chromosome 9p loss with CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion, one case showed hemizygous CDKN2A/B loss, and one case showed intact chromosome 9 and CDK4/GLI1 amplification. DNA methylation profiling was performed in four cases and revealed a match to glioblastoma (GBM) family and mesenchymal typical class with high confidence scores in two cases; the other two cases showed only suggestive combined scores for GBM family and mesenchymal atypical class. The molecular profile of all cases closely aligned with that of adult-type GBM, IDH-wildtype, CNS WHO grade 4. All patients succumbed to the disease. In five cases with extensive leptomeningeal disease at diagnosis, the course was rapid, with median survival of 24\u2009days following palliative care. Only one case, with relatively localized disease at diagnosis, received chemoradiation therapy and survived 535\u2009days, raising the possibility that early diagnosis and timely treatment could improve outcome.

Available systemic treatment options are few and ineffective, so new approaches to therapies for glioblastoma are in high demand. In total, 131 patients with diffuse glioma were studied. Paired tumor–normal samples were sequenced on the Illumina platform; the panel included 812 genes associated with cancer development. Molecular profiles in clinically distinct groups were investigated. In low-grade glioma (LGG) patients (n = 18), the most common mutations were IDH1/2 (78%), ATRX (33%), TP53 (44%), PIK3CA (17%), and co-deletion 1p/19q (22%). In high-grade glioma (HGG) patients (n = 113), more frequently affected genes were CDKN2A/B (33%), TERTp (71%), PTEN (60%), TP53 (27%), and EGFR (40%). The independent predictors of better prognosis were tumor grade and IDH1/2 mutations. In IDH—wildtype glioblastoma patients, a history of other precedent cancer was associated with worse overall survival (OS), while re-operation and bevacizumab therapy increased OS. Also, among genetic alterations, TERTp mutation and PTEN deletion were markers of poor prognosis. Nine patients received molecular targeted therapy, and the results were evaluated. The search for molecular changes associated with tumor growth and progression is important for diagnosis and choice of therapy.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

Although TP53 mutations are prevalent in glioblastoma (GBM), the mechanisms by which TP53 regulates iron metabolism remain elusive. We reveal an imbalance iron homeostasis in GBM via TCGA database analysis. TP53 mutations disrupted iron homeostasis in GBM, characterized by elevated total iron levels and reduced ferritin (FTH). The gain-of-function effect triggered by TP53 mutations upregulates itchy E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (ITCH) protein expression in astrocytes, leading to FTH degradation and an increase in free iron levels. TP53-mut astrocytes were more tolerant to the high iron environment induced by exogenous ferric ammonium citrate (FAC), but the increase in intracellular free iron made them more sensitive to Erastin-induced ferroptosis. Interestingly, we found that Erastin combined with FAC treatment significantly increased ferroptosis. These findings provide new insights for drug development and therapeutic modalities for GBM patients with TP53 mutations from iron metabolism perspectives.\n\nConsider:\n1.

While some studies suggest a survival advantage for gcGB patients, the underlying causes remain elusive. GcGBs are associated with TP53 mutations, and gcs were shown to accumulate DNA double-strand breaks and show deficient mitosis, potentially triggering cellular senescence programs. Epigenetic clocks have emerged as valuable tools for assessing tumor-induced age acceleration (DNAMethAgeAcc), which has lately proved itself as prognostic biomarker in glioblastoma. Our study aimed to comprehensively analyze the methylome and key metabolic proteins of gcGBs, hypothesizing that they undergo cellular aging programs compared to non-gcGBs. A total of 310 epigenetically classified GBs, including 26 gcGBs, and nine adults with malignant gliomas allocating to pediatric high-grade glioma molecular subclasses (summarized as "pediatric GB") were included. DNAMethAgeAcc was computed by subtraction of chronological patient ages from DNA methylome-derived age estimations and its increase was associated with better survival within gcGB and non-gcGB. GcGBs were significantly more often allocated to the subgroup with increased DNAMethAgeAcc and demonstrated the highest DNAMethAgeAcc. Hypothetical senescence/aging-induced changes of the tumor microenvironment were addressed by tumor deconvolution, which was able to identify a cluster enriched for tumors with increased DNAMethAgeAcc. Key metabolic protein expression did not differ between gcGB and non-gcGB and tumor with versus without increased DNAMethAgeAcc but for elevated levels of one single mitochondrial marker, anti-mitochondrial protein MT-C02, in gcGBs. With its sped-up epigenetic aging, gcGB presented as the epigenetic oldest GB variant in our cohort. Whereas the correlation between accelerated tumor-intrinsic epigenetic aging and cellular senescence in gcGB stays elusive, fostering epigenetic aging programs in GB might be of interest for future exploration of alternative treatment options in GB patients.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Using gene editing protocol based on CRISPR-Cas 9 with cytidine deaminase, we introduced point mutations into U87MG glioblastoma cells to establish modified cell lines with heterozygous IDH1 R132H, homozygous TP53 R248Q and heterozygous IDH1 R132H, homozygous TP53 R248Q genotypes. A comparative study of cell migration on major ECM components was carried out by high-content microscopy. IDH1 R132H mutation introduced to U87MG glioblastoma cells was shown to decrease the migration speed on Matrigel and collagen IV substrates compared to the wild-type. This data were supported by cell adhesion quantification via the lateral shift assay performed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). TP53 R248Q mutation increased cell adhesion to various substrates and significantly promoted cell migration on hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate but did not change the migration rates on laminin and collagens IV and I. A double-mutant genotype produced by consequently introducing IDH1 R132H and TP53 R248Q to parental glioblastoma cells was characterized by the highest migration among all the cell lines, with particularly faster motility on chondroitin sulfate. These findings underscore the complex interactions between glioma cells, with the most important driver mutations and specific ECM components regulating cancer cell migration, offering valuable insights for potential therapeutic targets in glioma treatment.\n\nConsider:\n1.

This subtype is associated with significant heterogeneity, chemoresistance, early recurrence, metastasis, and poor patient survival. FOXM1 is a cancer-promoting transcription factor that plays a critical role in TNBC and other highly aggressive cancers by driving cell proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance. In TNBC, mutations in the TP53 gene-detected in approximately 80% of patients-lead to the overexpression of FOXM1, making it a promising therapeutic target. Beyond TNBC, FOXM1 is implicated in other solid cancers, such as brain (glioblastoma), lung, and pancreatic cancers, and is considered an Achilles' heel of aggressive cancers. Despite its potential as a therapeutic target, there are currently no FDA-approved FOXM1 inhibitors, and none have advanced to clinical trials. This review explores the role of FOXM1 in cancer progression and highlights the current status of efforts to develop effective FOXM1 inhibitors.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from GBM cells contain important biomarkers, such as microRNAs, proteins, and DNA mutations, which are involved in tumor progression, invasion, and resistance to treatment. Identifying surface markers on these EVs is crucial for their isolation and potential use in noninvasive diagnosis. This study aimed to use tumor-derived explants to investigate the surface markers of EVs and explore their role as diagnostic biomarkers for GBM. Tumor explants from nine GBM patients without IDH1/IDH2 mutations or 1p-19q co-deletion were cultured to preserve both tumor viability and cytoarchitecture. EVs were collected from the tumor microenvironment using differential centrifugation, filtration, and membrane affinity binding. Their surface protein composition was analyzed through multiplex protein assays. RNA-Seq data from TCGA and GTEx datasets, along with in silico single-cell RNA-seq data, were used to assess EV surface biomarker expression across large GBM patient cohorts. The in vitro model successfully replicated the tumor microenvironment and produced EVs with distinct surface markers. Biomarker analysis in large datasets revealed specific expression patterns unique to GBM patients compared with healthy controls. These markers demonstrated potential as a GBM-specific signature and were correlated with clinical data. Furthermore, in silico single-cell RNA-seq provided detailed insights into biomarker distribution across different cell types within the tumor. This study underscores the efficacy of the tumor-derived explant model and its potential to advance the understanding of GBM biology and EV production. A key innovation is the isolation of EVs from a model that faithfully mimics the tumor's original cytoarchitecture, offering a deeper understanding of the cells involved in EV release. The identified EV surface markers represent promising targets for enhancing EV isolation and optimizing their use as diagnostic tools. Moreover, further investigation into their molecular cargo may provide crucial insights into tumor characteristics and evolution.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

Approximately 8% of GBM cases exhibit genomic alterations in fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs), particularly FGFR1 and FGFR3. Next-generation sequencing techniques have identified various FGFR3 fusions in GBM. This report presents a novel FGFR3 fusion with fatty acid synthase (FASN) in a 41-year-old male diagnosed with GBM. The patient presented with a persistent headache, and imaging revealed a right frontal lobe lesion. Surgical resection and subsequent histopathology confirmed GBM. Initial NGS analysis showed no mutations in the IDH1, IDH2 or H3F3 genes, but revealed a TERT promoter mutation and CDKN2A/2B and PTEN deletions. Postoperative treatment included radiotherapy and temozolomide. Despite initial management, recurrence occurred four months post-diagnosis, confirmed by MRI and histology. A second surgery identified a novel FGFR3-FASN fusion, alongside increased Ki67 expression. The recurrence was managed with regorafenib and bevacizumab, though complications like hand-foot syndrome and radiation necrosis arose. Despite initial improvement, the patient died 15 months after diagnosis. This case underscores the importance of understanding GBM's molecular landscape for effective treatment strategies. The novel FGFR3-FASN fusion suggests potential implications for GBM recurrence and lipid metabolism. Further studies are warranted to explore FGFR3-FASN's role in GBM and its therapeutic targeting.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2. Study type and methodology\n3.

Despite current therapies, the 5-year survival rate is 5%-10%. The authors report a case with a durable long-term response to immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibition in a patient with LFS-associated GBM. An 18-year-old female presented after a syncopal episode and left leg weakness and was found to have a right frontal tumor. She underwent gross-total resection of the tumor (grade IV giant cell GBM IDH-wildtype, MGMT unmethylated, associated with a p53 germline mutation), radiation, and chemotherapy. On later imaging, increased enhancement was demonstrated, which raised concerns for tumor recurrence, and she underwent stereotactic radiosurgery followed by lomustine and procarbazine. These agents were later replaced with bevacizumab after a second resection, negative for recurrent glioma. Subsequently, nivolumab was added, given concerns for tumor progression, and the patient showed improvement within 5 months. The patient has continued nivolumab monotherapy and has had progression-free survival for more than 7 years. Despite advances in treatment, the median survival of patients with GBM is only 15 months. This case highlights the potential of immunotherapy with PD-L1 checkpoint inhibition in improving outcomes for LFS-associated GBM patients. https://thejns.org/doi/10.3171/CASE24539.\n\nConsider:\n1.

However, the molecular underpinnings of the heterogeneous response to the current standard-of-care treatment regimen consisting of maximal safe resection, adjuvant radiation, and chemotherapy with temozolomide remain unknown. Comprehensive histopathologic, genomic, and epigenomic evaluation of paired initial and recurrent glioblastoma specimens from 106 patients was performed to investigate the molecular evolution and cellular phenotypes underlying differential treatment responses. While TERT promoter mutation and CDKN2A homozygous deletion were early events during gliomagenesis shared by initial and recurrent tumors, most other recurrent genetic alterations (eg, EGFR, PTEN, and NF1) were commonly private to initial or recurrent tumors indicating acquisition later during clonal evolution. Furthermore, glioblastomas exhibited heterogeneous epigenomic evolution with subsets becoming more globally hypermethylated, hypomethylated, or remaining stable. Glioblastoma that underwent sarcomatous transformation had shorter interval to recurrence and were significantly enriched in NF1, TP53, and RB1 alterations and the mesenchymal epigenetic class. Patients who developed somatic hypermutation following temozolomide treatment had significantly longer interval to disease recurrence and prolonged overall survival, and increased methylation at 4 specific CpG sites in the promoter region of MGMT was significantly associated with this development of hypermutation. Finally, an epigenomic evolution signature incorporating change in DNA methylation levels across 347 critical CpG sites was developed that significantly correlated with clinical outcomes. Glioblastoma undergoes heterogeneous genetic, epigenetic, and cellular evolution that underlies prognostically different treatment responses.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

ALDH1A1 is a primary metabolic enzyme impacting the outcome of chemotherapy, including temozolomide. High expression of ALDH1A1 is associated with poor prognosis in multiple cancers, suggesting PPIs may have a negative impact on survival. Real-world data on GBM patients was annotated from electronic medical records (EMR) according to the prospective observational study, XCELSIOR (NCT03793088). Patients with known <i>IDH1/2</i> mutations were excluded. Causal effects on survival were analyzed using a multivariate, time-varying Cox Proportional Hazard (CPH) model with stratifications including <i>MGMT</i> methylation status, age, sex, duration of corticosteroid use, extent of resection, starting standard-of-care, and PPI use. EMR data from 554 GBM patients across 225 cancer centers was collected, with 72% of patients receiving care from academic medical centers. Patients treated with PPIs (51%) had numerically lower median overall survival (mOS) and 2-year OS rates in the total population and across most strata, with the greatest difference for MGMT-methylated patients (mOS 29.2 vs. 40.1 months). In a time-varying multivariate CPH analysis of the above strata, PPIs caused an adverse effect on survival (HR 1.67 [95% CI: 1.15-2.44], <i>P</i>\u2005=\u2005.007). Evidence from a nationwide cancer registry has suggested PPIs have a negative impact on OS for GBM patients, particularly those with <i>MGMT</i> promoter methylation. This suggests PPIs should be avoided for prophylactic management of gastrointestinal toxicity in patients with GBM receiving chemoradiotherapy.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

However, the inherent heterogeneity of GBM often results in suboptimal outcomes, particularly due to varying degrees of resistance to TMZ. Over the past several decades, O<sup>6</sup>-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT)-mediated DNA repair pathway has been extensively investigated as a target to overcome TMZ resistance. Nonetheless, the combination of small molecule covalent MGMT inhibitors with TMZ and other chemotherapeutic agents has frequently led to adverse clinical effects. Recently, additional mechanisms contributing to TMZ resistance have been identified, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, overactivation of intracellular signalling pathways, energy metabolism reprogramming or survival autophagy, and changes in tumor microenvironment (TME). These findings suggest that novel therapeutic strategies targeting these mechanisms hold promise for overcoming TMZ resistance in GBM patients. In this review, we summarize the latest advancements in understanding the mechanisms underlying intrinsic and acquired TMZ resistance. Additionally, we compile various small-molecule compounds with potential to mitigate chemoresistance in GBM. These mechanism-based compounds may enhance the sensitivity of GBM to TMZ and related chemotherapeutic agents, thereby improving overall survival rates in clinical practice.\n\nConsider:\n1.

This study aimed to review and summarize the literature on the systemic therapy of malignant gliomas.\xa0Chemotherapy may be considered in grades 2 and 3 gliomas, especially when mutations in 1p19q-codeletion are detected. The beneficial impact of adding chemotherapy to radiotherapy (PCV: procarbazine, lomustine, vincristine) has also been demonstrated. In grade 4 glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), wild-type isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) status showed the best treatment outcomes with temozolomide (TMZ) in patients with O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT)\xa0promoter methylation. Prolonging adjuvant TMZ therapy improves treatment outcomes compared to the standard 6-cycle adjuvant therapy. Bevacizumab (BEV) monotherapy can improve progression-free survival and maintain the initial quality of life. Despite advancements in GBM treatment, outcomes remain unsatisfactory, with a median survival of 14-16 months. Further research is still needed regarding the systemic treatment of central nervous system gliomas.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2. Study type and methodology\n3.

Neuropathological diagnostic precision and clinical follow-up treatment has been further increased by combining DNA methylation profiling with targeted panel sequencing. A few new, molecularly defined tumor subtypes have been proposed, among others, a glioneuronal tumor with <i>ATRX</i> alteration, kinase fusion and anaplastic features (in its abbreviated form named GTAKA) and the de novo replication repair deficient glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype both having either distinct prognostic or therapeutic implications. Regarding the understanding of brain tumor development and progression, several novel mechanisms have been presented which might also be considered as treatment targets in the future, such as a) autonomous rhythmical Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in interconnected glioma cell networks driving tumor growth; b) transfer of mitochondria from normal astrocytes to glioma cells enhancing proliferation and self-renewal; c) brain endothelial cell remodeling upon matrix-metalloprotease 9 secretion by tumor cells metastasizing into the CNS and d) anti-tumor activity of microglia in CNS metastasis of breast cancer. Finally, in contrast to previous years, several very promising neurooncological treatment studies have been conducted, focusing on specific targets such as H3K27M or IDH1/2 mutations for which a proper neuropathological assessment is key. The continuous translation of potential new treatment targets using faster and precise diagnostic procedures will further pave the way for better individualized clinical care of neurooncological patients.\n\nConsider:\n1.

The 2021 WHO classification of brain tumors and recent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) pathology agnostic drug approvals highlight the importance of molecular testing in the management of glioma. For diffuse gliomas, it is important to identify IDH mutations, given the favorable clinical behavior and potential for using FDA approved IDH inhibitors in the near future. MGMT promoter methylation testing is the most established molecular marker for response to temozolomide in IDH wild-type glioblastoma and in turn impacts overall survival. Moreover, identification of certain mutations and molecular markers, such as BRAF V600E, hypermutation or elevated tumor-mutational burden and NTRK fusions allow for the use of FDA approved agents that are tumor-agnostic. Finally, molecular testing opens options for clinical trials that are essential for diseases with limited treatment options like gliomas.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

The authors explored survival rates and factors associated with long-term survival in patients harboring a glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype. In an observational, retrospective, single-center study, the authors examined the medical records of 976 adults newly diagnosed with supratentorial glioblastomas, IDH-wildtype between January 2000 and January 2021. They analyzed clinical-, imaging-, and treatment-related factors associated with 2-year and 5-year survival. The median overall survival was 11.2 months (12.2 months for patients included after 2005 and the introduction of standard combined chemoradiotherapy). The median progression-free survival was 9.4 months (10.0 months for patients included after 2005). Overall, 17.6% of patients reached a 2-year overall survival, while 2.2% of patients reached a 5-year overall survival. Furthermore, 6.6% of patients survived 2 years without progression, while 1.1% of patients survived 5 years without progression. Two factors that were consistently associated with 2-year and 5-year survival were first-line oncological treatment with standard combined chemoradiotherapy and methylated O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter. Other factors that were significantly associated with 2-year or 5-year survival were age at diagnosis ≤ 60 years, headaches or signs of raised intracranial pressure at diagnosis, cortical contact of contrast enhancement, no contrast enhancement crossing the midline on initial imaging, total or subtotal tumor resection, and a second line of oncological treatment at recurrence. Within 21 cases of 5-year survival, 18 were confirmed to be glioblastomas, IDH-wildtype, and 7 of the 5-year survivors (38.9%) had additional genetic alterations: 3 cases had an FGFR mutation or fusion, 3 cases had a PIK3CA mutation, 1 case had a PTPN11 mutation, and 1 case had a PMS2 mutation in the context of constitutional mismatch repair deficiency syndrome. Five-year overall survival in patients with glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype is extremely low. Predictors of a longer survival are mostly treatment factors, emphasizing the importance of a complete oncological treatment plan, when achievable. Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype 5-year survivors could be screened for actionable targets in case of recurrence.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2. Study type and methodology\n3. Population characteristics\n4. Intervention or exposure\n5. Outcomes measured\n\nRespond with only 'yes' or 'no'."}], 'model': 'chatgpt-4o-latest', 'max_tokens': 100, 'temperature': 0.3}}

Available systemic treatment options are few and ineffective, so new approaches to therapies for glioblastoma are in high demand. In total, 131 patients with diffuse glioma were studied. Paired tumor–normal samples were sequenced on the Illumina platform; the panel included 812 genes associated with cancer development. Molecular profiles in clinically distinct groups were investigated. In low-grade glioma (LGG) patients (n = 18), the most common mutations were IDH1/2 (78%), ATRX (33%), TP53 (44%), PIK3CA (17%), and co-deletion 1p/19q (22%). In high-grade glioma (HGG) patients (n = 113), more frequently affected genes were CDKN2A/B (33%), TERTp (71%), PTEN (60%), TP53 (27%), and EGFR (40%). The independent predictors of better prognosis were tumor grade and IDH1/2 mutations. In IDH—wildtype glioblastoma patients, a history of other precedent cancer was associated with worse overall survival (OS), while re-operation and bevacizumab therapy increased OS. Also, among genetic alterations, TERTp mutation and PTEN deletion were markers of poor prognosis. Nine patients received molecular targeted therapy, and the results were evaluated. The search for molecular changes associated with tumor growth and progression is important for diagnosis and choice of therapy.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

Expression subtypes of GBM samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were identified using BayesNM and compared with existing molecular subtypes of GBM. Biological features of the subtypes were determined by single-sample gene set enrichment analysis. Genomic and proteomic data from GBM samples were combined and Genomic Identification of Significant Targets in Cancer analysis was used to screen genes with recurrent somatic copy-number alterations phenomenon. The immune environment among subtypes was compared by assessing the expression of immune molecules and the infiltration of immune cells. Molecular subtypes adapted to immunotherapy were identified based on Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) score. Finally, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression was performed on the expression profiles of S2, S3 and S4 in TCGA-GBM and RPPA to determine the respective corresponding best predictive model. Four novel molecular subtypes were classified. Specifically, S1 exhibited a low proliferative profile; S2 exhibited the profile of high proliferation, IDH1 mutation, TP53 mutation and deletion; S3 was characterized by high immune scores, innate immunity and adaptive immune infiltration scores, with the lowest TIDE score and was most likely to benefit from immunotherapy; S4 was characterized by high proliferation, EGFR amplification, and high protein abundance, and was the most suitable subtype for bevacizumab. LASSO analysis constructed the best prediction model composed of 13 genes in S2 with an accuracy of 96.7%, and the prediction model consisting of 17 genes in S3 with an accuracy of 86.7%, and screened 14 genes as components of the best prediction model in S4 with an accuracy of 93%. To conclude, our study classified reproducible and robust molecular subtypes of GBM, and these findings might contribute to the identification of patients responding to immunotherapy, thereby improving GBM prognosis.\n\nConsider:\n1.

To address these issues and personalise treatment approaches, we aimed to develop and validate robust multiomics molecular subtypes of IDHwt-GBM. Through this, we sought to uncover the distinct molecular signatures underlying these subtypes, paving the way for improved diagnosis and targeted therapy for this challenging disease. To identify stable molecular subtypes among 184 IDHwt-GBM patients from TCGA, we used the consensus clustering method to consolidate the results from ten advanced multiomics clustering approaches based on mRNA, lncRNA, and mutation data. We developed subtype prediction models using the PAM and machine learning algorithms based on mRNA and MRI data for enhanced clinical utility. These models were validated in five independent datasets, and an online interactive system was created. We conducted a comprehensive assessment of the clinical impact, drug treatment response, and molecular associations of the IDHwt-GBM subtypes. In the TCGA cohort, two molecular subtypes, class 1 and class 2, were identified through multiomics clustering of IDHwt-GBM patients. There was a significant difference in survival between Class 1 and Class 2 patients, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.68 [1.15-2.47]. This difference was validated in other datasets (CGGA: HR\u2009=\u20091.75[1.04, 2.94]; CPTAC: HR\u2009=\u20091.79[1.09-2.91]; GALSS: HR\u2009=\u20091.66[1.09-2.54]; UCSF: HR\u2009=\u20091.33[1.00-1.77]; UPENN HR\u2009=\u20091.29[1.04-1.58]). Additionally, class 2 was more sensitive to treatment with radiotherapy combined with temozolomide, and this sensitivity was validated in the GLASS cohort. Correspondingly, class 2 and class 1 exhibited significant differences in mutation patterns, enriched pathways, programmed cell death (PCD), and the tumour immune microenvironment. Class 2 had more mutation signatures associated with defective DNA mismatch repair (P\u2009=\u20090.0021). Enriched pathways of differentially expressed genes in class 1 and class 2 (P-adjust\u2009<\u20090.05) were mainly related to ferroptosis, the PD-1 checkpoint pathway, the JAK-STAT signalling pathway, and other programmed cell death and immune-related pathways. The different cell death modes and immune microenvironments were validated across multiple datasets. Finally, our developed survival prediction model, which integrates molecular subtypes, age, and sex, demonstrated clinical benefits based on the decision curve in the test set. We deployed the molecular subtyping prediction model and survival prediction model online, allowing interactive use and facilitating user convenience. Molecular subtypes were identified and verified through multiomics clustering in IDHwt-GBM patients. These subtypes are linked to specific mutation patterns, the immune microenvironment, prognoses, and treatment responses.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

It is the aim of this study to evaluate differences in the treatment-related clinical course of these tumors as they are largely unknown. Patients undergoing surgery (between 2016-2019 in six neurosurgical departments) for a histologically diagnosed WHO grade 2-3 IDH1/2-wt astrocytoma were retrospectively reviewed to assess progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and prognostic factors. This multi-center study included 157 patients (mean age 58\xa0years (20-87\xa0years); with 36.9% females). The predominant histology was anaplastic astrocytoma WHO grade 3 (78.3%), followed by diffuse astrocytoma WHO grade 2 (21.7%). Gross total resection (GTR) was achieved in 37.6%, subtotal resection (STR) in 28.7%, and biopsy was performed in 33.8%. The median PFS (12.5\xa0months) and OS (27.0\xa0months) did not differ between WHO grades. Both, GTR and STR significantly increased PFS (P\u2009<\u20090.01) and OS (P\u2009<\u20090.001) compared to biopsy. Treatment according to Stupp protocol was not associated with longer OS or PFS compared to chemotherapy or radiotherapy alone. EGFR amplification (P\u2009=\u20090.014) and TERT-promotor mutation (P\u2009=\u20090.042) were associated with shortened OS. MGMT-promoter methylation had no influence on treatment response. WHO grade 2 and 3 IDH1/2 wt astrocytomas, treated according to the same treatment protocols, have a similar OS. Age, extent of resection, and strong EGFR expression were the most important treatment related prognostic factors.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2. Study type and methodology\n3.

The mutational spectrum and DNA methylation patterns are homogeneous within de novo pAIDHmut/G4 and evolved sAIDHmut/G4, but the two groups have different diagnoses, management, and outcomes. This study sought to systematically compare the clinical, pathological, and survival characteristics between them. Of the 871 grade 4 astrocytomas with data for IDH mutation, 698 (80.1%) were primary and 173 (19.9%) were secondary. Of the 698 primary tumors, 103 (14.8%) were pAIDHmut/G4, and of the 173 secondary tumors, 108 (62.4%) were sAIDHmut/G4. Clinical, pathological, and survival features were compared between pAIDHmut/G4 and sAIDHmut/G4. Multivariate analyses were performed to identify prognostic factors. Patients with sAIDHmut/G4 had significantly shorter median overall survival (OS; 11.8 vs 34.2 months, hazard ratio [HR] 2.69, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.367-5.306, p = 0.004) and progression-free survival (PFS; 8.5 vs 24.3 months, HR 2.83, 95% CI 1.532-5.235, p = 0.001) than patients with pAIDHmut/G4. In patients with sAIDHmut/G4, resection status and chemotherapy were independent prognostic factors for OS and PFS; in patients with pAIDHmut/G4, LGG component, resection status, and O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase promoter methylation were independent prognostic factors. The therapeutic strategies of LGGs did not influence survival of patients with sAIDHmut/G4, but patients who had not received radiotherapy or chemotherapy when they were diagnosed with LGGs were found to benefit from radiotherapy or chemotherapy when they progressed to sAIDHmut/G4. The different clinical characteristics, survival, and risk factors between sAIDHmut/G4 and pAIDHmut/G4 provide a reference to guide treatment decisions in AIDHmut/G4.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Alleviating various modes of immune suppression has so far failed to achieve such expansion, but exploiting endogenous immune enhancers among mutated cancer genes could represent a more direct approach to immunotherapy improvement. We found that Isocitrate Dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1), which is commonly mutated in gliomas, enhances glioma vaccine efficacy in mice and discerns long from short survivors after vaccine therapy in GBM patients. Extracellular IDH1 directly enhanced T cell responses to multiple tumor antigens, and prolonged experimental glioma cell lysis. Moreover, IDH1 specifically bound to and exhibited sialidase activity against CD8. By contrast, mutant IDH1R132H lacked sialidase activity, delayed killing in glioma cells, and decreased host survival after immunotherapy. Overall, our findings identify IDH1 as an immunotherapeutic enhancer that mediates the known T cell-enhancing reaction of CD8 desialylation. This uncovers a new axis for immunotherapeutic improvement in GBM and other cancers, reveals novel physiological and molecular functions of IDH1, and hints at an unexpectedly direct link between lytic T cell function and metabolic activity in target cells.\n\nConsider:\n1.

The mechanisms underlying TIME formation and development over time are poorly understood. Glioblastoma (GBM) is a lethal primary brain cancer for which there are no curative treatments. GBMs are immunologically heterogeneous and impervious to checkpoint blockade immunotherapies. Utilizing clinically relevant genetic mouse models of GBM, we identified distinct immune landscapes associated with expression of EGFR wild-type and mutant EGFRvIII cancer driver mutations. Over time, accumulation of polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSC) was more pronounced in EGFRvIII-driven GBMs and was correlated with resistance to PD-1 and CTLA-4 combination checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. We determined that GBM-secreted CXCL1/2/3 and PMN-MDSC-expressed CXCR2 formed an axis regulating output of PMN-MDSCs from the bone marrow leading to systemic increase in these cells in the spleen and GBM tumor-draining lymph nodes. Pharmacologic targeting of this axis induced a systemic decrease in the numbers of PMN-MDSC, facilitated responses to PD-1 and CTLA-4 combination checkpoint blocking immunotherapy, and prolonged survival in mice bearing EGFRvIII-driven GBM. Our results uncover a relationship between cancer driver mutations, TIME composition, and sensitivity to checkpoint blockade in GBM and support the stratification of patients with GBM for checkpoint blockade therapy based on integrated genotypic and immunologic profiles.\n\nConsider:\n1.

The genetic characteristic still remains unclear until now. We reported a 47-year-old female patient with multiple intracranial disseminations and infiltrations (splenium of the corpus callosum and lateral ventricular wall) of a rapid progressive glioblastoma underwent occipital craniotomy and total resection of all the enhancing lesions. Whole-exome sequencing and pathological examination revealed glioblastoma, IDH1 wild type, PTEN deficient, TERT mutated, NF1mutated, MGMT unmethylated. After surgery, the patient received combined therapeutic regimen of TTFields (tumor-treating fields) plus pembrolizumab plus temozolomide and TTFields plus everolimus, which displayed significant clinical benefits. During the combined therapeutic course, an extremely rare secondary malignant neoplasm occurred, femur MR and pathological detection of biopsy tissue demonstrated osteosarcoma. The result of whole-exome sequencing revealed 7 germline mutated genes (EPAS1, SETD2, MSH3, BMPR1A, ERCC4, CDH1, AR). Bioinformatic analysis showed the two germline mutations (MSH3 and ERCC4) induced deficiency in the DNA repair machinery, which resulting in the accumulation of mutations and may generate neoantigens contributing to the development of a secondary osteosarcoma in this case. Individualized combination therapies based on whole-exome sequencing displayed significant clinical benefits in this case. Germline MSH3 and ERCC4 mutation may induce a secondary osteosarcoma in glioblastoma patients.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2. Study type and methodology\n3.

Currently, the prognostic outcome for GBM patients is dismal, even with intensive treatment, and the median overall survival (OS) is 14.6\xa0months. Immunotherapy, which is specific at the cellular level and can generate persistent immunosurveillance, is now becoming a promising tool to treat diverse cancers. However, the complicated nature of the tumor microenvironment (TME) makes it challenging to develop anti-GBM immunotherapy because several cell types, cytokines, and signaling pathways are involved in generating the immunosuppressive environment. Novel immunotherapies can illustrate novel tumor-induced immunosuppressive mechanisms. Here, we used unsupervised clustering analysis to identify different subtypes of immune cell infiltration that actuated different prognoses, biological actions, and immunotherapy responses. Gene cluster A, with a hot immune cell infiltration phenotype, had high levels of immune-related genes (IRGs), which were associated with immune pathways including the interferon-gamma response and interferon-alpha response, and had low <i>IDH1</i> and <i>ATRX</i> mutation frequencies. Gene cluster B, a cold immune cell infiltration subtype, exhibited a high expression of the <i>KCNIP2</i>, <i>SCRT1</i>, <i>CPLX2</i>, <i>JPH3</i>, <i>UNC13A</i>, <i>GABRB3</i>, <i>ARPP21</i>, <i>DLGAP1</i>, <i>NRXN1</i>, <i>DLL3</i>, <i>CA10</i>, <i>MAP2</i>, <i>SEZ6L</i>, <i>GRIA2</i>, and <i>GRIA4</i> genes and a low expression of immune-related genes, i.e., low levels of immune reactivity. Our study highlighted the complex interplay between immune cell infiltration and genetic mutation in the establishment of the tumor immune phenotype. Gene cluster A was identified as an important subtype with a better prognosis and improved immunotherapy response.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2. Study type and methodology\n3.

The MGMT promoter methylation status and its association with clinicopathological parameters were retrospectively analysed in a cohort of 316 patients with GBM with wild-type IDH. MGMT methylation was significantly associated with ATRX chromatin remodeler (ATRX) loss and completion of the standard Stupp protocol. The median durations of overall and progression-free survival for the unmethylated, low-methylated (10-39%), and hypermethylated (≥40%) groups were 15, 23, and 30 months and 11, 18, and 21 months, respectively. However, the improvement in the survival of the hypermethylated group was not statistically significant. We suggest a possible association between MGMT methylation status and ATRX mutations in GBM with wild-type IDH.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2. Study type and methodology\n3.

TP53 is the most common mutated gene in human cancer, occurring in 30-50% of glioblastomas (GBM). Here, we highlight a precision medicine platform to identify potential targets for a GBM patient with LFS. We used a comparative transcriptomics approach to identify genes that are uniquely overexpressed in the LFS GBM patient relative to a cancer compendium of 12,747 tumor RNA sequencing data sets, including 200 GBMs. STAT1 and STAT2 were identified as being significantly overexpressed in the LFS patient, indicating ruxolitinib, a Janus kinase 1 and 2 inhibitors, as a potential therapy. The LFS patient had the highest level of STAT1 and STAT2 expression in an institutional high-grade glioma cohort of 45 patients, further supporting the cancer compendium results. To empirically validate the comparative transcriptomics pipeline, we used a combination of adherent and organoid cell culture techniques, including ex vivo patient-derived organoids (PDOs) from four patient-derived cell lines, including the LFS patient. STAT1 and STAT2 expression levels in the four patient-derived cells correlated with levels identified in the respective parent tumors. In both adherent and organoid cultures, cells from the LFS patient were among the most sensitive to ruxolitinib compared to patient-derived cells with lower STAT1 and STAT2 expression levels. A spheroid-based drug screening assay (3D-PREDICT) was performed and used to identify further therapeutic targets. Two targeted therapies were selected for the patient of interest and resulted in radiographic disease stability. This manuscript supports the use of comparative transcriptomics to identify personalized therapeutic targets in a functional precision medicine platform for malignant brain tumors.\n\nConsider:\n1.

However, large databases with tissue metabolites that are modulated by IDH1 mutation remain an area of development. Here, we present an unprecedented and valuable resource for tissue metabolites in diffuse glioma and their modulations by IDH1 mutation, histology, and tumor treatments in 101 tissue samples from 73 diffuse glioma patients (24 astrocytoma, 17 oligodendroglioma, 32 glioblastoma), investigated by NMR-based metabolomics and supported by RNA-Seq. We discovered comparison-specific metabolites and pathways modulated by IDH1 (IDH1 mutation status cohort) and tumor entity. The Longitudinal investigation cohort provides metabolic profiles of untreated and corresponding treated glioma samples at first progression. Most interestingly, univariate and multivariate cox regressions and Kaplan-Meier analyses revealed that tissue metabolites correlate with progression-free and overall survival. Thus, this study introduces potentially novel candidate prognostic and surrogate metabolite biomarkers for future prospective clinical studies, aiming at further refining patient stratification in diffuse glioma. Furthermore, our data will facilitate the generation of so-far-unanticipated hypotheses for experimental studies to advance our molecular understanding of glioma biology.\n\nConsider:\n1.

The secluded onset site, combined with the infiltrative properties of this tumor, require novel targeted therapies. In this scenario, the use of oncolytic viruses retargeted to glioblastoma cells and able to spread across the tumor cells represent an intriguing treatment strategy. Here, we tested the specificity, safety and efficacy of R-613, the first oncolytic HSV fully retargeted to EGFRvIII, a variant of the epidermal growth factor receptor carrying a mutation typically found in glioblastoma. An early treatment with R-613 on orthotopically transplanted EGFRvIII-expressing human glioblastoma significantly increased the median survival time of mice. In this setting, the growth of human glioblastoma xenotransplants was monitored by a secreted luciferase reporter and showed that R-613 is able to substantially delay the development of the tumor masses. When administered as late treatment to a well-established glioblastomas, R-613 appeared to be less effective. Notably the uninfected tumor cells derived from the explanted tumor masses were still susceptible to R-613 infection ex vivo, thus suggesting that multiple treatments could enhance R-613 therapeutic efficacy, making R-613 a promising oncolytic HSV candidate for glioblastoma treatment.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Despite its poor prognosis, its rarity has precluded analysis of its underlying biology. We used a multi-center database to characterize the genomic landscape of gliosarcoma. Sequencing data was obtained from 35 gliosarcoma patients from Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange (GENIE) 5.0, a database curated by the American Association of Cancer Research (AACR). We analyzed genomic alterations in gliosarcomas and compared them to GBM (n\u2009=\u20091,449) and soft tissue sarcoma (n\u2009=\u20091,042). 30 samples were included (37% female, median age 59 [IQR: 49-64]). Nineteen common genes were identified in gliosarcoma, defined as those altered in\u2009>\u20095% of samples, including TERT Promoter (92%), PTEN (66%), and TP53 (60%). Of the 19 common genes in gliosarcoma, 6 were also common in both GBM and soft tissue sarcoma, 4 in GBM alone, 0 in soft tissue sarcoma alone, and 9 were more distinct to gliosarcoma. Of these, BRAF harbored an OncoKB level 1 designation, indicating its status as a predictive biomarker of response to an FDA-approved drug in certain cancers. EGFR, CDKN2A, NF1, and PTEN harbored level 4 designations in solid tumors, indicating biological evidence of these biomarkers predicting a drug-response. Gliosarcoma contains molecular features that overlap GBM and soft tissue sarcoma, as well as its own distinct genomic signatures. This may play a role in disease classification and inclusion criteria for clinical trials. Gliosarcoma mutations with potential therapeutic indications include BRAF, EGFR, CDKN2A, NF1, and PTEN.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2. Study type and methodology\n3.

While EGFR and EGFRvIII play critical roles in pathogenesis, targeted therapy with EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors or antibodies has shown limited efficacy. To improve the likelihood of effectiveness, we targeted adult patients with recurrent GB enriched for simultaneous EGFR amplification and EGFRvIII mutation, with osimertinib/bevacizumab at doses described for non-small cell lung cancer. We retrospectively explored whether previously described EGFRvIII mutation in association with EGFR gene amplification could predict response to osimertinib/bevacizumab combination in a subset of 15 patients treated at recurrence. The resistance pattern in a subgroup of subjects is described using a commercial next-generation sequencing panel in liquid biopsy. There were ten males (66.7%), and the median patient's age was 56\xa0years (range 38-70\xa0years). After their initial diagnosis, 12 patients underwent partial (26.7%) or total resection (53.3%). Subsequently, all cases received IMRT and concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ; the median number of cycles 9, range 6-12). The median follow-up after recurrence was 17.1\xa0months (95% CI 12.3-22.6). All patients received osimertinib/bevacizumab as a second-line intervention with a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 5.1\xa0months (95% CI 2.8-7.3) and overall survival of 9.0\xa0months (95% CI 3.9-14.0). The PFS6 was 46.7%, and the overall response rate was 13.3%. After exposure to the osimertinib/bevacizumab combination, the main secondary alterations were MET amplification, STAT3, IGF1R, PTEN, and PDGFR. While the osimertinib/bevacizumab combination was marginally effective in most GB patients with simultaneous EGFR amplification plus EGFRvIII mutation, a subgroup experienced a long-lasting meaningful benefit. The findings of this brief cohort justify the continuation of the research in a clinical trial. The pattern of resistance after exposure to osimertinib/bevacizumab includes known mechanisms in the regulation of EGFR, findings that contribute to the understanding and targeting in a stepwise rational this pathway.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Thirty adults with H3.3 G34-mutant diffuse gliomas were retrospectively reviewed for clinical and pathologic information. Molecular profiling using next-generation sequencing was performed in 29 of the 30 H3.3 G34-mutant patients with 1 patient lacking available tumor samples, as well as 82 IDH/H3 wild-type adult diffuse glioma patients. The age at diagnosis of H3.3 G34-mutant diffuse gliomas was significantly younger than IDH/H3 wild-type gliomas (24 vs. 57\u2009y, P<0.001). Overall, 19 of the 30 patients were diagnosed of glioblastoma with the primitive neuronal component, and 8 were glioblastoma. The molecular profiling analysis revealed higher frequencies of Olig-2 loss of expression, TP53 mutation, ATRX mutation, PDGFRA mutation, and MGMT promoter methylation (P<0.05) in H3.3 G34-mutant gliomas than IDH/H3 wild-type gliomas. No TERT promoter mutation and only 1 case of EGFR amplification were detected in the H3.3 G34-mutant cohort, the frequencies of which were significantly higher in the IDH/H3 wild-type cohort. A dismal prognosis was observed in H3.3 G34-mutant patients comparing to IDH/H3 wild-type cohort (overall survival: 14 vs. 22\u2009mo; P=0.026). Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that the extent of resection and TP53 mutation were independently affecting prognosis. The distinct pathologic and molecular features of H3.3 G34-mutant diffuse gliomas in adult patients demonstrated the clinical importance of detecting H3.3 G34R/V mutations. The dismal prognosis of this rare high-grade glioma disease we reported here would further promote the investigation of dedicated therapeutic strategies.\n\nConsider:\n1.

A phase III clinical trial showed that tumor treating fields (TTFields) monotherapy provided comparable survival benefits to physician's chemotherapy choice in rGBM. However, patients did not equally benefit from TTFields, highlighting the importance of identifying predictive biomarkers of TTFields efficacy. A retrospective review of an institutional database with 530 patients with infiltrating gliomas was performed. Patients with IDH-WT rGBM receiving TTFields at first recurrence were included. Tumors were evaluated by next-generation sequencing for mutations in 205 cancer-related genes. Post-progression survival (PPS) was examined using the log-rank test and multivariate Cox-regression analysis. 149 rGBM patients were identified of which 29 (19%) were treated with TTFields. No significant difference in median PPS was observed between rGBM patients who received versus did not receive TTFields (13.9 versus 10.9\xa0months, p\u2009=\u20090.068). However, within the TTFields-treated group (n\u2009=\u200929), PPS was improved in PTEN-mutant (n\u2009=\u200914) versus PTEN-WT (n\u2009=\u200915) rGBM, (22.2 versus 11.6\xa0months, p\u2009=\u20090.017). Within the PTEN-mutant group (n\u2009=\u200970, 47%), patients treated with TTFields (n\u2009=\u200914) had longer median PPS (22.2 versus 9.3\xa0months, p\u2009=\u20090.005). No PPS benefit was observed in PTEN-WT patients receiving TTFields (n\u2009=\u200979, 53%). TTFields therapy conferred a significant PPS benefit in PTEN-mutant rGBM. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underpinning the differences in response to TTFields therapy could help elucidate the mechanism of action of TTFields and identify the rGBM patients most likely to benefit from this therapeutic option.\n\nConsider:\n1.

As several ongoing studies are investigating T-cell based immunotherapy in GBM, we conducted this study to assess whether peritumoral edema with potentially increased intracranial pressure, disrupted tissue homeostasis and reduced local blood flow has influence on immune infiltration and affects survival. A volumetric analysis of preoperative imaging (gadolinium enhanced T1 weighted MRI sequences for tumor size and T2 weighted sequences for extent of edema (including the infiltrative zone, gliosis etc.) was conducted in 144 patients using the Brainlab® software. Immunohistochemical staining was analyzed for lymphocytic- (CD 3+) and myelocytic (CD15+) tumor infiltration. A retrospective analysis of patient-, surgical-, and molecular characteristics was performed using medical records. The edema to tumor ratio was neither associated with progression-free nor overall survival (p=0.90, p=0.74). However, GBM patients displaying IDH-1 wildtype had significantly higher edema to tumor ratio than patients displaying an IDH-1 mutation (p=0.01). Immunohistopathological analysis did not show significant differences in lymphocytic or myelocytic tumor infiltration (p=0.78, p=0.74) between these groups. In our cohort, edema to tumor ratio had no significant correlation with immune infiltration and outcome. However, patients with an IDH-1wildtype GBM had a significantly higher edema to tumor ratio compared to their IDH-1 mutated peer group. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the underlying mechanisms.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2. Study type and methodology\n3. Population characteristics\n4.

Low levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are beneficial for cells and have anti-cancer effects. ROS are produced in the mitochondria during ATP production by oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). In the present review, we describe ATP production in primary brain tumors, glioblastoma, in relation to ROS production. Differentiated glioblastoma cells mainly use glycolysis for ATP production (aerobic glycolysis) without ROS production, whereas glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) in hypoxic periarteriolar niches use OXPHOS for ATP and ROS production, which is modest because of the hypoxia and quiescence of GSCs. In a significant proportion of glioblastoma, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (<i>IDH1</i>) is mutated, causing metabolic rewiring, and all cancer cells use OXPHOS for ATP and ROS production. Systemic therapeutic inhibition of glycolysis is not an option as clinical trials have shown ineffectiveness or unwanted side effects. We argue that systemic therapeutic inhibition of OXPHOS is not an option either because the anti-cancer effects of ROS production in healthy cells is inhibited as well. Therefore, we advocate to remove GSCs out of their hypoxic niches by the inhibition of their binding to niches to enable their differentiation and thus increase their sensitivity to radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy.\n\nConsider:\n1.

We aimed to investigate the biological and clinical factors that affect survival in Turkish patients with primary GBM. The clinical and demographic data of all patients with primary GBM diagnosed between 2007 and 2016 were evaluated. In all the patients? pathological specimens, O6 methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) methylation and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 mutation were detected retrospectively by immunohistochemistry. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, log-rank test, and multivariate analyses of the Cox hazard proportional model for all the variables were performed using the SPSS statistical package. The treatment details and other patient-related factors were identified, and their correlations were analyzed. We enrolled 137 primary GBM patients to the study. Median progression free survival (PFS) was 8.57 months (95% CI:6.8-9.5) and median overall survival (OS) was 12 months (95% CI:10.8-13.3). IDH-1 mutations were detected in 21 primary GBMs (15.3%). PFS was 15.43 ± 1.95 months. Survival rates were higher, but no statistically significant difference (p=0.074). MGMT methylation was detected in 40 primary GBMs (29.2%). OS and PFS of MGMT (+) cases were higher than MGMT(-) cases (p=0.001; p=0.001 respectively). Ki67 (%) measurement (10%-90%) average is 32.64 ± 16.56. No statistically significant between higher and lower ki67 levels (p=0.510, p=0.505 respectively). KPS (%) more than 70 at the time of diagnosis statistically significant longer median OS and PFS (p=0.001). PFS and OS were higher in all treatment modalities. The most important factors that affected survival were performance score, MGMT methylation status, systemic oncologic therapy, and IDH mutation in the Turkish population with primary GBM. We demonstrated that MGMT methylation and higher KPS levels were associated with significiantly longer OS and PFS.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2. Study type and methodology\n3.

We performed a retrospective study of adult glioblastoma patients treated at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/Brigham and Women's Hospital or Massachusetts General Hospital from January 2011 to July 2019 with an identified BRAF V600E mutation by either immunohistochemistry or molecular testing. Patient characteristics, molecular genomics, and preoperative MRI were analyzed. Nineteen glioblastoma patients were included, with median age at diagnosis of 41-years-old (range 22-69). Only 1/18 was IDH1/2-mutant; 10/17 had MGMT unmethylated tumors. The most common additional molecular alterations were CDKN2A/2B biallelic loss/loss-of-function (10/13, 76.9%), polysomy 7 (8/12, 66.7%), monosomy 10 (5/12, 41.7%), PTEN biallelic loss/loss-of-function (5/13, 38.5%) and TERT promoter mutations (5/15, 33.3%). Most tumors were well-circumscribed (11/14) and all were contrast-enhancing on MRI. Twelve patients eventually developed subependymal or leptomeningeal dissemination. Six patients were treated with BRAF/MEK inhibition following disease progression after standard of care therapy, with 4/6 patients showing partial response or stable disease as best response. Median time to progression after BRAF/MEK inhibition was 6.0\xa0months (95% CI 1.2-11.8). Grade 1 skin rash was present in 2 patients, but no other adverse events were reported. Median OS for the entire cohort was 24.1\xa0months (95% CI 15.7-38.9). Understanding the natural history and features of BRAF V600E glioblastoma may help better identify patients for BRAF/MEK inhibition and select therapeutic strategies.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Recent studies suggested that telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter hotspot mutations may have an impact on the prognostic role of the MGMT status in patients with glioblastoma. MGMT promoter methylation and TERT promoter mutation status were retrospectively assessed in a prospective cohort of patients with IDH-wild-type glioblastoma of the German Glioma Network (GGN) (n\xa0=\xa0298) and an independent retrospective cohort from Düsseldorf, Germany, and Zurich, Switzerland (n\xa0=\xa0302). In the GGN cohort, but not in the Düsseldorf/Zurich cohort, TERT promoter mutation was moderately associated with inferior outcomes in patients with MGMT promoter-unmethylated tumours (hazard ratio 1.74; 95% confidence interval: 1.07-2.82; p\xa0=\xa00.026). TERT promoter mutations were not associated with better outcomes in patients with MGMT promoter-methylated tumours in either cohort. The two different TERT promoter hotspot mutations (C228T and C250T) were not linked to distinct outcomes. Analysis of two independent cohorts of patients with glioblastoma did not confirm previous data, suggesting that TERT promoter mutations confer an enhanced benefit from TMZ in patients with MGMT promoter-methylated glioblastoma. Thus, diagnostic testing for TERT promoter mutations may not be required for prediction of TMZ sensitivity in patients with IDH-wild-type glioblastoma.\n\nConsider:\n1.

Given the rarity of epithelioid glioblastoma, the clinical characteristics, pathological features, radiological findings, and treatment outcomes are still not well characterized. Therefore, we identified eighty-four epithelioid glioblastoma cases to investigate these characteristics and identify the possible prognostic factors of survival. There were 55 male and 29 female patients with a mean age of 33.6 years. Headache (77.3%) was the most common clinical symptom, and other common symptoms included nausea or vomiting (34%), dizziness (20.5%), seizures (13.6%), and limb weakness (13.6%). Most lesions (88.1%) were located in cerebral lobes, especially in the frontal lobe and temporal lobe. One hundred percent of the patients were IDH1 wild-type (75/75) and INI-1 positive (58/58), and 57.3% (47/82) of patients harbored BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> mutation. The median overall survival (OS) of all patients was 10.5 months. Patients who received chemotherapy (p = 0.006) or radiotherapy (p = 0.022) had a longer survival than patients who did not. In addition, the K-M curve showed that the BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> mutation status was not associated with survival (p = 0.724). These findings may assist clinicians with better understanding and management of epithelioid glioblastoma.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2. Study type and methodology\n3.

Importantly, molecular changes in EGFR-dependent signaling is one of the most common characteristics of brain tumors. HER1 and EGFRvIII variants in meningiomas and glioblastomas were evaluated at the RNA level. EGFRvIII was found in 18.6% of glioblastomas (GBM), whereas 25% of EGFRvIII positive tumors express wild-type EGFR as well. HER1 was over-expressed in benign meningiomas compared to glioblastomas, whereas HER1 expression in meningiomas differed significantly between sub-types of meningiomas. EGFRvIII and HER1 where positively correlated in glioblastomas. Yet, the patient overall survival did not differ between high- and low-HER1 expressing glioblastomas or between EGFRvIII positive and negative GBMs. HER1 may be considered as an independent factor for classification of benign meningiomas. The mRNA levels of HER1 or EGFRvIII should not be used as independent prognostic factors for patients with gliomas.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2.

The goal of this study was to quantify oncogenic differences and evaluate the overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) differences in GBM patients across race/ethnicity using both population-based surveillance and institutional data sets from the United States (US) and Mexico. Retrospective cohort study comprising the Texas Cancer Registry (TCR, n = 4134) and referral institutions located in US (n = 254) and Mexico (n = 47) were evaluated. Primary outcomes include OS and PFS. Oncogenic differences attributable to ethnicity were assessed. IDH1/IDH2 status was evaluated by sequencing in US and Mexico samples. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards regression for survival analysis. A total of 4134 GBM patients were identified from the TCR data set, ethnicity comparison demonstrated that Hispanic patients were diagnosed at a significantly younger age compared to non-Hispanic white patients (NHW) (median: 58 vs. 62, P < 0.001) and had improved OS (hazard ratio: 0.82, P < 0.001). In the oncogenic analysis, we observed a significant enrichment of IDH1/IDH2 mutations in Mexican Hispanic patients compared to US Hispanic patients (29.8% vs. 7.9%, P = 0.012); IDH2 mutations drove this difference. Post-progression survival was significantly shorter in patients from Mexico than US (3.0 vs. 11.4 months; P < 0.001), while OS remained similar. IDH2 mutations are more prevalent in Mexican Hispanic individuals compared to US individuals and may be a crucial contributor to the previously reported survival benefit of Hispanic individuals in large population databases. These findings are critical for both screening of IDH2 mutations and targeted interventions in GBM.\n\nConsider:\n1. Direct relevance to the question\n2. Study type and methodology\n3. Population characteristics\n4. Intervention or exposure\n5. Outcomes measured\n\nRespond with only 'yes' or 'no'."}], 'model': 'chatgpt-4o-latest', 'max_tokens': 100, 'temperature': 0.3}}
